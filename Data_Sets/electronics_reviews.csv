1.0,strength overestimated..,"I researched for several weeks for an articulating mount for my 50&#34; flat screen.  The reviews for this were outstanding.  So i put it on my wishlist, and received it for Christmas.<br /><br />-first knock against it, the back plate (that mounts flush to the wall) isn't a single piece.  It is 3 pieces of metal bolted together with hex bolts (hex wrench not included).  Other, higher quality, mounts are a single piece for regidity.<br />- a LOT of assembly required.  assembly isn't a big deal for me, as i'm fairly handy and have no trouble following crappy diagram directions.  but when its holding something this valuable... better directions would be appreciated.<br />- the claim is that this fits up to 65&#34; tvs and can hold 165lbs.  well, i can't comment on the 65&#34; claim, but i can say that the tv bracket was maxed out on my 50&#34; (but i'm assuming all tv's over a certain size have mounting screws in the same location, so their claim may be accurate).. but the 165lb claim, i'm calling bs.  my 50&#34; plasma weighs just under 100lbs (which was why i went with what I understood to be a &#34;beefier&#34; mount).  This system has 2 verticle pieces that mount to the tv, and they attach to a horizontal bar that is part of the wall mount.

5.0,Perfect iPhone writers companion.,"I’m excited about this keyboard.<br /><br />I bought it to turn my aging iPhone Se (older version) into a writing machine because my MacBook’s screen no longer works due to a... coffee related incident. I wanted to start writing again and realized that even though my phone is super old, it’s also still super snappy compared even to my laptop, making it an ideal typewriter.  At this task, paired with a Bluetooth mouse and stand, it works perfectly. Once paired, it seamlessly finds my phone whenever I turn it on and maintains the connection without issue.<br /><br />There are a number of keyboards on Amazon with the same design but it’s a good one. It feels solidly built but also thin when you pick it up.  The battery (non replaceable) compartment acts as a handle and also angles they keyboard down slightly like most keyboards.  At $20 it is a perfectly serviceable product despite some minor design flaws.<br /><br />There are a number of iOS related adjustments the designers made to this keyboard layout that are different from a standard one meant for a desktop. The most notable examples are the replacement of the escape key with a “home” button key and the delete key which puts your iOS device to sleep/lock. The escape key switcharoo is actually very intuitive as they have very similar functions. I double tap the home/esc key to pull up the task switcher and tab through applications like i used to do on my mac. You will find all the global shortcut keys, where the function keys are, to work as expected. Screen brightness, volume, screen capture etc.<br /><br />Oddly the designers replaced the right hand “command and option” buttons with a dedicated backlight on/off toggle and accompanying RGB button. It’s a strange compromise but even with my heavy keyboard navigation in iOS, I never find I miss them. That said I also wish they would have just put the backlighting button or switch on the back side of the keyboard. I occasionally push them unintentionally but it’s not bothersome at all. The on/off switch and paring button are on the bottom of the keyboard which is more inconvenient than having it accessible on the rear or side of the keyboard. Instead I’m either flipping the whole thing over or fumbling with my finger underneath, often mistaking the on/off button for the Bluetooth pairing button. Again it’s fine for $20 and my usage. I’m picking it up and chucking it in my bag all the time anyway so it’s not that noticeable and doesn’t really mess with the seamless flow of turning the phone in my pocket into a mini portable typewriter.<br /><br />I haven’t run the battery down yet but it does seem to drain rather quickly. I don’t expect the battery to last forever but you could easily plug it into a battery pack which I usually have anyway when sitting with my phone for long writing sessions. The company says you can use it while it’s charging so it will still be usable if the battery does fail someday. Again for $20, battery life is not a deal breaker. I haven’t tested it but think it would last many hours on a full charge while backlit I forget what is advertised.<br /><br />The battery might be draining faster because I tend to use it in the dark. I bought the backlit version for this reason and as such find any color setting other than red to be too bright for my taste. I’d be happy with just an on/off button without the RGB options.

The Bluetooth paired with my phone right away and I like the SD Micro slot on the front - makes it easy to toss in a ready-to-play mix!

The pre-configured EQ settings (Pop, Rock, Classical, etc.) were not to my liking but you can just shut them off and adjust the bass/treble the way you want it. For the price...I am very happy! Also comes with a small remote (so the passenger can mess with the stereo while I'm driving?).

After the mail in rebate, the price was pretty good.<br /><br />Once the box arrived, I was happy with the purchase. If you changed the Lepa branding for Corsair, you wouldn't feel any performance or quality penalty whatsoever. It's simply a well made, well designed item. Installation was pretty easy even though the instructions could be better, but in any case it was installed quickly and was working in no time. Since then, I dont feel that I've ever seen my CPU temperatures much above 40ºc, independant of what I was doing. And that has included it's fair share of 3D modelling, so I'm pretty satisfied.<br /><br />All in all, it might not be the best watercooler out there, but for the price I think you can't beat it.

But you don't know until the event you have just recorded is over that the recording didn't work! Up to that point, everything looks like it was working perfectly.  :-(<br />  Also, the wide angle feature is not for everyone. If you need to use one camera to capture a group of people it can be very useful. But if you want to use this as a conventional, but higher quality, web cam, the wide angle is actually a problem.

It is much easier to work with than the on-screen keyboard, though you don't have the auto-correct when you are using it. There is a key for switching to the on-screen keyboard when you want it.<br />The folio is nice. It can be folded into various viewing angles, like the Apple smart cover, and the ""micro suction"" pad holds the iPad in place either in landscape or portrait. The best part is that I can tuck the keyboard back under the flap and lay the folio almost flat with the iPad facing up when I want to just use the screen. That lets me leave the iPad in the folio almost all of the time. The only times I would have to remove it would be when I wanted to stand it up in portrait mode or when I wanted to use it as a camera. (The camera could be used with the flap folded back, but the keyboard would be annoying hanging there while you are trying to take a picture.)<br />My only complaint is that the charging cable uses the iPad adapter, so you can't charge the keyboard and the iPad at the same time.

3.0,Hard to See,"I really liked the look of the black edition online, but when I got it, I found it very hard to read the time.  Also, some of the data tracking seems questionable.  For example, it's telling me that I slept the night ""uninterrupted"" yet it was a horrible night sleep filled with tossing and turning.  Also, if you work with your hand a lot, it will see that as steps.  So, every day I stand stationary and anywhere from 30 - 100 packages for shipping.  By the time I am done, the watch reports hundreds of steps taken when I hadn't moved.  Since this has a built in GPS, it should be able to use it to confirm that steps are actual steps.  All in all, I liked it enough for the price to return it and get the white version.  I will continue to give it a shot.  Love the hybrid concept and hope this works out in the long run.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Got the white model and it's way better.  Looks sharp and much easier to read.  However, it still suffers from counting repetitive hand movements as steps.  Also, the software does not honor the phone's do not disturb settings.  So, if you have notifications turned on, you can expect your wrist to vibrate all hours of the night.  Pretty glaring error in my opinion.

5.0,"Great, pure copper","Great, pure copper, heatsinks!<br /><br />While the days of using them on VGA RAM are likely over, they still allow one to place these on small IC's on a variety of devices.  Personally I have them on my Raspberry Pi's and other SBC (Single Board Computers) to help them dissapate as much heat as they can.  While I don't overclock too much I primarily picked these up for the then, unreleased, Raspberry Pi 3 which had rumored early on (read: Reddit and other hobby/maker forums) to really put out some heat while over-utilized.  While I've never had an issue with mine overheating, I cannot say it wasn't because of these heatsinks; since they have been on all 3 of my devices before they ever saw power.<br /><br />They stick well although some care MUST be taken to get the paper backing off the stick-pad as delicately as possible.  I can imagine someone new or looking for something like this might heavy-hand it and get the sticky-pad dirty or fingerprinted.  This will result in loss of sticking power and I can believe that possibly some lower than normal reviews were due to improper handling and use.  Who knows exactly but the batch I've received have worked well and I'm storing them in a cool, dry place for future use.

5.0,A very robust protective case with good ergonomics and useful features at a bargain price.,"Pros:<br />Very good corner & edge protection.<br />Excellent fit & finish.  All port cutouts align correctly.<br />Main stand supports in either portrait or landscape.  Secondary stand supports at shallow angle in landscape only.<br />Secure, comfortable hand loop on back that can be rotated 360 deg. to desired position.<br />I was already familiar with Targus products from my experience with their laptop bags.<br />Takedown latch locks closed with a small ""key"", or peg.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />Takedown latch lock ""key"" is not tethered.  It has to be rotated 90deg. to be removed, and so is unlikely to be lost.  A spare is included.<br />The stylus holder could be convenient for those who use a stylus.  I don't, but the holder appears to be well designed.<br />Case comes with a an adjustable shoulder/carry strap that is easily installed and removed.  It can be tucked into the hand loop when not in use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Only comes in black.<br />Slightly stiff power button cover.<br />No dust cover flaps for the power or headphone ports.<br /><br />This iPad case was gifted to me at my request.  It exhibits the same fine quality and well thought out features as their laptop bags.  It was not particularly easy to find on Amazon's listing; had to wade through many lesser-quality cases at higher prices to find it.<br /><br />Fit & finish are first rate +.  All the cutouts for the ports align correctly.  The included installation instructions were easy, clear and most appreciated.  Corner and edge drop protection is very good.  No ""screen protector"" is included but, I feel they are superfluous anyway.  No screen protector I've ever seen will protect from a striking blow that will crack the glass.  A screen protector may protect from scratches, but the glass is difficult to scratch in the first place.  The case front bezel is of hard plastic (nylon?), and raises the glass perhaps 3mm. from a surface if placed screen-down.<br /><br /> The main stand is robust and strong, and will support the device in either portrait or landscape orientation (a rare & valuable feature) at about a 50 deg. angle.  A second, built-in short stand will support the device at a shallow angle on a flat surface in landscape only.<br /><br /> The adjustable hand loop built into the main stand is comfortable & convenient that allows a secure, one-handed hold.  It can be rotated through 360 deg. for the most comfortable position. The included shoulder/carry strap can be tucked into the hand loop to keep it out of the way.  The carry strap is adjustable for length, and can be easily removed and installed as desired.<br /><br />The power button is covered by the softer rear cover.  There is a raised tab where the power button resides underneath.  The firm material of the rear cover is fairly stiff, requiring a firm press to actuate the power button.<br /><br />The stylu holder is a nice touch for those who use one.<br /><br />This case is not sold as being water-or-dust-resistant.  There are no dust cover flaps for the power or headphone ports.<br /><br />Overall, this case is very robust, with very useful features at a bargain price.  Unless one truly needs protection from water or dust ingress, it would be difficult to find a better protective case with equally-useful features at any price.",[],B008N37U3G,B008N37U3G,AF654LJWZQA4USHFBZV4J2WZFENQ,1545848583377,0,False

3.0,"Works for my Macbook Pro, most of the time.","[[VIDEOID:d3a7444ea04d11b66243fad33b193f83]] Initial 4-star review: I recently got a new MBP and was surprised by the lack of a MagSafe charging mechanism. Though not a clumsy user, I was stunned when such a wonderful feature was taken away. Is it so wrong to dedicate one port for charging?? Thankfully, there are other innovators besides Apple, and there's a market for a magnetic USB-C cable.<br /><br />The cable charges great! The braided cord bends nicely. The magnetic strength feels correct for its purpose: not too strong but not too weak either. The part which goes into the laptop is very small and can stay there. And, that's good because it takes some force to remove that part from the laptop. I wish there was a notch or something to grip on to for an easier removal.<br /><br />I'm still very pleased with this useful product for easing one worry from my mind. Thank goodness for clever inventors.<br /><br />Downgraded to 3-stars on 1/16/2019 a week later: There have been few instances when the cable wouldn't charge. I don't know if this is due to the magnetic portion or the USB-C portion. This doesn't happen often at all. The cable didn't provide charge maybe twice. Some wiggling or re-insertion may help.<br /><br />This video was taken two days after my first review, and the cable hasn't failed since then - please ignore the comment in the video stating ""sometimes it works"" because it works a lot more often and usually. I also didn't remove and re-insert the dongle after finding a sweet spot. That's a good-enough ratio for me, but what concerns me is if the electronic components are safe and compliant. For now, I trust it enough to use it, but not quite at 100%.<br /><br />Edited on 1/19/2018: Well, it didn't work today, and I haven't removed the dongle since my last edit. I love the magnetic feature, but this is too unreliable. As much as I want this cable to be my usual cable, I wouldn't travel with it. Oh well. Still, this cable works more often than not, so it's good for a household with clumsy kids or pets. I'll be using the Apple-supplied cable until a more reliable magnetic cable is available.",[],B07JVGGNDR,B07JVGGNDR,AHKGGFWXAEA2DA7RDLFUFLJDZCQQ,1546859514142,0,False

5.0,Excellent Occasional/Emergency Rain Protection,"I bought a pack of these sleeves to use when shooting outdoor sports in the rain.  I'm not a pro photographer and couldn't justify the expense of the superior Aquatech rain gear.  I needed something small and light that fits in my camera backpack and keeps me shooting during poor weather conditions I occasionally encounter.<br /><br />If you do a lot of shooting in questionable weather and can justify the $200 cost, the Aquatech is obviously a better solution.  But for $6, the Op/Tech sleeves are hard to beat in a pinch, particularly for casual photographers.<br /><br />The sleeves are large enough to cover most all but the largest of the pro telephoto lenses.  It fits my D300 with battery pack and 70-200 2.8 with room to spare.  The sleeve has a hole in the rear - just remove your eyepiece cover, stretch the hole over the eyepiece, and replace the cover to hold it in place.  The sleeve has a drawstring closure in front that holds very securely to the lens hood.  The plastic is transparent and thin enough to allow operation of all the controls right through the sleeve (vs, sliding your hands up inside).  It's a very usable solution, although it does make adjusting the zoom a bit more difficult.  But again, this is intended to be more of an emergency or occasional rain solution.<br /><br />I've spent endless hours shooting football games in the rain and the protection provided is excellent.  As long as you don't poke a hole in it, your equipment will stay dry.  I'm able to reuse them multiple times.<br /><br />Pros:  Very low cost, stores anywhere, excellent protection, low tech ease of use, able to see all of the camera's controls, works with tripods and monopods.<br /><br />Cons:  Takes a few minutes to put on and get adjusted, makes accessing some controls a little awkward (but not impossible), far too long for short lenses.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Excellent emergency protection during occasional bad weather for cameras with larger lenses.

4.0,Decent value projector,"UPDATE: The seller, VIMGO DIRECT, has been responsive to some issues I had with the projector, so I am adding a star to the rating. Many sellers fail to respond to post purchase issues, so this is a good sign that this seller stands behind the products they sell.<br />____________<br /><br />This is the third projector I’ve owned. My previous projector was 720P with approximately 500 ANSI lumens. This projector is sharper and brighter than the projector so I would estimate it to be about 750 lumens. Text appears sharper and contrast is definitely an improvement over my previous projector, however, you would still only be able to use this in a room with very subdued lighting.<br /><br />Physically, the projector itself looks nice and feels solid. The plastic used on the enclosure is quite thick and makes the projector heavy for its size.<br /><br />The interface is decent—fairly simple with icons. There are presets for color and audio modes with the ability to save a custom setting. There is an option to rotate the screen if you need to mount the projector from the ceiling. You can digitally zoom the image down to 25% to fit your wall.<br /><br />Keystone adjustment is only vertical and limited to 15 degrees, so the projector needs to be horizontally centered on your wall/screen. The keystone adjustment is mostly useless if you’re using the projector to show content with text and sharp lines as text smears and doubles up making reading difficult. I really miss the 4-way keystone feature of my previous projector.<br /><br />It does not play 4K content! The projector was advertised as supporting 4K content when I purchased it, but would not play any 4K files from a USB stick—the 1080P files played fine. I contacted the seller and they did reply with an apology and have since modified the description on the webpage.<br /><br />The project’s internal speakers can get quite loud. It’s not high-fidelity in any way, but is good enough for you to hear dialog in a medium sized room. There’s no bluetooth, but there is a headphone jack to connect an external speaker.<br /><br />The fan is quite loud. Using a sound-level app on my iPhone, the fan noise runs about 49dB sitting a couple of feet from the projector. It’s not an issue if you’re watching an action movie, but gets annoying if it’s a movie without a lot of background music<br /><br />Focus is slightly difficult. The focus knob on top is stiff and the texture on the knob isn’t deep enough, so you need to get a fingernail into the grooves to focus. In terms of screen focus, there is some fall off of sharpness towards the corners and edges—it’s not terrible, as you can still read the slightly blurry text. This isn’t a problem if you’re watching a movie.<br /><br />There are two USB slots, but one is dedicated to connecting a tablet or phone for mirroring. This worked well to mirror content from my iPad.<br /><br />The projector has wi-fi and it did work, but occasionally lost the connection. This happened more often if you were projecting a photo slide show rather than viewing a video via wi-fi. Navigating to reconnect isn’t easy and takes a quite a few clicks.<br /><br />I connected an Amazon FireTV 4K stick using the USB port and that worked seamlessly. Initially had a problem in which there wasn’t any audio while using the FireTV—I had to go into the projector’s sound options and turn off surround sound.<br /><br />Overall, a decent projector for the $140 I paid for it. I’m primarily using it to project images for murals I paint and maybe the occasional action movie night. The biggest detractors are the lack of decent key-stoning, fan noise, and lack of ability to play 4K files from a USB stick.",[],B092ZGPY6L,B092ZGPY6L,AGAOGRORYOZEOA4GOBT37NHYUQ3A,1630360090137,9,True

4.0,"Great case, just one flaw...","This is a great case. This case provides 360° protection, and the clear back allows the beautiful red color of my iPod Touch 5g to show through...However, the clear back can be scratched very easily, also, when putting the loop accessory through the hole before you put on the case (which is the only way to put on the loop) it bends the loop up a bit causing some minor folding to the connection method on the loop. That is only a minor issue though since I rarely use the loop anyway.<br /><br />So overall this case is very nice, sleek, and comfortable, but there is another case that I would recommend over this one. The Poetic Atmosphere; [[ASIN:B009N4VVGQ Poetic Atmosphere Case Cover for Apple iPod Touch 5 5G 5th Generation (CLEAR / GRAY) - 2012 NEWEST MODEL]]. As you may be looking at it now, you may see that the clearness of this is case is not very nice, but with the red iPod, it shows through beautifully! Trust me. It is a very nice case that offers the same that this one does but more. This case has the clear back, the much better cut out for the loop that does not fold the loop upward when in use, provides the thinness as well. But best of all, it costs only about $5 (not including the shipping) I have already purchased this case and it is a much better alternative compared to the Griffin Reveal.

5.0,Sleek little voice recorder!!!,"I'm a college student and I have so many things going on that I would forget everything. I use to use my phone to write things down in a note app but that became tedious. Having to pull out your phone, unlock it, look for the app, type in the message. Now imagine doing this like 100 times a day. Another reason I hate pulling out my phone is because I will get distracted with a notification or someone texting me and forget what I was going to write down. With this voice recorder, you just pull it out of your pocket, move the switch to record, speak, move the switch back and you're done. You can listen to it later with a headphones.  It even has a headphone jack.  Its also an mp3 player and store music files. The build quality is solid. I love this thing and won't leave home without it.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713rpZ2KYZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713rpZ2KYZL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713rpZ2KYZL._SL256_.jpg'}

2.0,"Make sure to get extra batteries before you buy, the remote uses them daily....","I have used Amazon for a long time, and I have never received an item this disappointing before; until I received this. Don't get me wrong, I like the Fire TV itself, the reason I'm not giving this a higher review is because the remote control sucks. It is easy enough to use, but I have to change batteries every other day because it just eats them up so fast; and that's with taking them out every night when it's not in use. When I called customer support they agreed with me that this should not be happening, but unfortunately because it seams that replacement remote's are an item that sells out almost as soon as they come in they couldn't send me a new one because they are out of stock. In my opinion if you have a product that totally relies on the use of something like a remote you should always make sure to keep a certain amount in inventory that is just for warranty replacement use and not sell all of you stock. Yes there is an app that I can download, but that is beside the point in my opinion. I paid a good price for this item and if it's reliant on having a working remote because there isn't any buttons on the box itself to control it in any way then I should have working products.<br />As for the fire TV itself, it works just great as long as the remote is working.

5.0,Worth every penny at home and for users with ADHD,"I lost a bet with my pre-teen when his dad saw the finished installation and immediately said “I want one!”<br />Having had a sit-to-stand desk at work, when we all began working and schooling from home due to COVID-19, I decided to order this for my pre-teen. He has ADHD and his bedroom is very small with two slanted walls. Doing something to put the angled walls to use as well as giving him the flexibility to sit or stand throughout the “school day” has made a huge difference. While this wouldn’t be possible for everyone, for a pre-teen or short adult the height is adjustable enough to adapt from standing, to sitting in a desk chair, to kicking back in a low height moon chair while gaming with friends (or watching TV?).<br />The one thing I will say is that mounting this on the stud in your walls is going to be much safer and stronger than trying to mount it with anchors in drywall. Seeing the amount of tension and torque you can put on it, I wouldn’t want to have tried mounting this with anchors. I did try using the anchors provided for the CPU mount and like all plastic anchors, they failed to deploy, leaving giant holes in the wall that I had to patch and repaint. Since I mounted this on an angled wall and didn’t feel like taking another crack at the CPU mount, my solution was to put the CPU on top of a short set of angled shelves (placed backwards against our walls to use up as much of the angled space as we can) that sit next to the wall mount).  If you do want to try working with wall anchors, I would strongly recommend buying something better than the plastic ones provided.",[],B07YVM37BZ,B0BHD6R3GX,AE2336W53IG7YXJVWUEKSJMPAQYQ,1590330679244,4,True

It has a magnetic frame to make it stick to the PC's case on top of the rear fan, but unsurprisingly, it's a weak magnet, and can fall off if touched, so I added two small refrigerator magnets, and that works ok. I may add a larger stronger refrigerator magnet.<br /><br />The filter screen does not seem to slow airflow to speak of. Note that I have it covering an intake fan. It's possible that it would tend to get blown off by a strong outward-facing fan, but I think adding refrigerator magnets is advisable in any case.<br /><br />I looked at a lot of possible solutions before settling on this. Beware positive reviews from people who aren't paying attention to whether some particular solution impedes airflow or not, because the things that *do* impede airflow will cause the interior temperature to rise, but that's not visible if one isn't monitoring temperatures -- except that components may fail much earlier due to heat, or in some cases they may throttle themselves down to avoid overheating, reducing performance.<br /><br />I subtracted one star for having such a weak magnetic frame.",[],B00DL4BKEW,B07RWDZ3HG,AFP2FOC5DVSU4TT4JV3WZB3PQNCA,1579650721540,0,True

I use an external monitor to extend my MacBook display for work, and as a standalone for my Xbox. While working I'll be constantly shifting focus between the two displays. I found a setting that should be OK for now, but I'll probably end up handing this down to my daughter or selling it and buying an LG Ultrafine display when they're more readily available, even though they're more expensive and require an adapter for non-Apple devices.<br /><br />Besides color, I think the display itself looks great. It has a matte display but it's not grainy at all like some cheaper matte displays tend to be. Despite having a hard time calibrating the color, the colors are nice and there are a lot of settings available to adjust to your preferences.

At first I got Ballistix 1600 8g (2x) which was not listed on the supported RAM list. I realized this was the culprit of many a problem when trying to OC and BIOS would turn the speed down. I was able to OC it to 4.05ghz but RAM was down to 910mhz. Then I upgraded from HDD to M.2 (clean<br /> OS install) and was only able to OC to 3.850ghz. I was able to find Hyper X KHX16C9P1K2/16 2x 8gb 1600mhz for less money did the swap and now have the OC at 4.05ghz and RAM at 1600mhz. I can get it to the 4.25ghz but not with the cooler I have  and besides its already above the level I wanted to get it to for a living room media center. The Audio chip set is really nice, optical out and dolby 7.1 which makes it nice for a media center build.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />- One would normally pay 2x for the features<br />- M.2 opens the door to up to date loading and program performance<br />- 7.1 Audio w/ optical out<br />- Lots of fan headers<br />- Looks good in windowed case<br />- Packaged well and installed easy<br />- Was able to overclock a build I didn't think I was going to<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />-2400mhz RAM for this does exist, but there is only one supported and you will not find it<br />-RAM list is pretty much terrible<br />-Fan control in BIOS does work, but its interface is really annoying<br />-BIOS is finicky even with all mfg approved hardware<br />-This is running with two intake fans in the front, two exhaust up top  and one in the back to rid of the CPU cooler heat. If you don't have fan city going on your chip set will be hot<br /><br />Did not give 5 stars because although my struggle was due to not using approved RAM, the approved RAM list was so short and awkward that I felt compelled to test its accuracy. The 2400mhz was misleading, not impossible, but pretty close to impossible to achieve. Ended up pretty happy though. I mess with computers a lot.

It has stretchable netting on both sides to hold water for hiking great easy to adjust straps, a good amount of space in the main compartment (I've been known to shove loads of stuff in it at once like an XBox 360, a text book, first aid kit, and light clothing), a nice smaller zip compartment to separate items, an even smaller area, secured with a zipper, inside the secondary compartment to isolate those really small objects, a ring to hold your keys, and little slots to hold various miscellaneous items.  There's also a nice chest strap/buckle that helps alleviate some of the weight on your shoulders/back when carrying a heavy load over a long distance.  It's not as great as a waist strap, but hey, it's just a backpack.  The only way to go wrong with this one is if you actually need more room.

5.0,Excellent features for the price; works great with two Panasonic video devices,"If you're upgrading to support 3D, this could be a great device for you.<br /><br />Background:  I found a great deal on a Panasonic 3D TV, and decided to upgrade my whole home theater simultaneously.  A friend recommended I buy a blu-ray player from the same manufacturer as the 3D TV to ensure that I didn't get caught up in any ""proprietary technology"" issues (and maybe that wasn't necessary?), but had been so happy with two prior Sony receiver/amps that I didn't want to switch loyalties for the heart of my upgraded system.  I've also got pre-HDMI CD and DVD carousels that I wanted to be able to connect, and the STR-DN1010 has a huge variety of inputs for those of us who aren't upgrading everything at once.<br /><br />The review:  Everything's working great, and set-up (thanks to HDMI) wasn't hard at all.  Thanks to the variety of ""sound fields"" the device produces, you can customize quite readily, and the Digital Cinema Automatic Calibration feature makes speaker set-up quick and easy.<br /><br />I've yet to find a remote code that works on my Panasonic blu-ray player, but that's what keeps Logitech's Harmony remote series selling, right?",[],B003JC3Z58,B003JC3Z58,AH4XVHM7K2V4COF52HKQW3C6UNBA,1300626204000,1,True

5.0,what's not to love,"Replacement for 20 year old sony<br />Makes 20 year speakers sound great<br />NETWORK-well this explained poorly so I thought I should elaborate. This model has no wireless connectivity but there's an add on device that you can get from Yamaha. Me, I have it hard wired to my home network. Essential for using free app from Apple or Android as a remote. While I can access media over my network, including ITunes music folder, I haven't worked out how to access playlists. Personally I blame Apple for trying to police the world for this, not Yamaha. I might point out too, that wireless connections that are capable of streaming HD video are only just coming to the market. I managed to access my playlists by using a handy USB that you can connect a smartphone or ipod to. The odd thing about the DLNA feature, there's no shuffle. I got around this with the app, just thought it was weird that after all the engineering there's no shuffle feature. Anyway, run a hard wire. The receiver is capable of many different speaker combinations so don't worry if you only have 2 to start. That part of the interface is pretty easy.<br />REMOTE Setting up the receiver is complicated. I even had to read the directions and actually think about what I wanted to do. There's an onscreen menu that's only mildly understandable. There's a manual that's like 130 pages long. You might download that first for details about features.<br />As I add speakers I update my review.<br />1/19/2014 Update<br />Downloaded the Yamaha AV remote from GooglePlay Store to droid so here's my review. I did a LOT of research before buying a receiver with a network connection. I suppose that I am like so many that hope to access media from my computer/network and play it in the living room. I hoped that a ""network receiver"" would make this simple. Alas, not it's not simple. The Yamaha is certainly biased for use with Apply products. Yes there's an Android version. This receiver is capable of Airplay supposedly however not able to access iTunes playlists via a hardwire connection. The RX-675 requires an additional Yamaha Wireless Network dongle for wireless connections, maybe Airplay will work with this. Silly really, when I actually bothered to run a network line up to the living room for smooth streaming. And while the receiver will can access playlists from WindowsMediaPlayer it's currently not possible to export iTunes playlists to WMP without loosing resolution. I am certainly not going to rip 100's of CD's again just to use WMP with the Yamaha. Just gonna get another Ipod and leave it connected.",[],B00B981F1U,B00B981F1U,AEN3KFTFYXFUSH4NRRZRJS2KICCA,1388178655000,2,False

5.0,Easy quality digital-to-analog converter,"I purchased DAC converter to connect a Samsung flat screen TV (no analog sound-out ports) to a Keiid tabletop CD receiver (https://www.amazon.com/KEiiD-Bluetooth-Portable-Component-Soundbar/dp/B07CPMRKNH/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Keiid+D+player&qid=1616669287&sr=8-3) Suffering from very typical age-related hearing loss, I had recently moved the Samsung into a bedroom, where my Keiid mini system lived. Specialized sound bars with 'hearing aid technology' did NOT make voice any clearer, so I decided to try a different track. The Keiid (a respectable Bose Wave radio alternative for the $$ conscious), only has RCA analog inputs. With the Prozor DAC converter, I have stumbled upon the Holy Grail for older folks who want to hear and understand voices and conversation on their flat screen TVs! Simple hookup; I rolled the dice that the mild-mannered Keiid tabletop would give me the right balance of high fidelity sound but with clearer voice. Being a cabinetized VW car CD radio pullout, it has a really good equalizer, it's own remote and somehow the digital-to-analog approach yielded crystal-clear voice with background sound and music appropriately attenuated. The magic is NOT using an external speaker option with a digital input. Nearly all newer TVs have only digital/optical sound-out; nearly all sound bars and home theater systems are digital-in. So, I am thrilled with this little converter and will be purchasing another for my new Samsung Q80T now in my living room and will port it's sound into the analog aux-in sound inputs on my home theater receiver. I will report back. Seniors take note.",[],B00KNNSKV0,B00KNNSKV0,AETDMQR7LW75ANUTYJSE7VDDREGQ,1616670387274,0,True

Yes, the red cable I ordered, with serial:4VL7FF, was detective and after receiving an email from an anker support member, they quickly emailed a brand new, but black cable :( she said they don't have anymore red. So I guess I'm going to give a 3 starts overall. 5 stars on customer support; 2 stars on dependability and not ending up with what I actually wanted.<br /><br />Edit #2 10/22/16: I should have done this sooner but I got the replacement in April and about 2 or so months ago I bent the new one too. These seem to have those cheap crappy microusb male ends that bend super easily because I accidentally bent mine by sitting on it while in my bed. I only weigh 130 lbs. So needless to say, I can't get one to last more than like 5 months at a time. I would most definitely avoid. Although their customer service was nice and they tried.<br /><br />Edit #3 11/1/16: Well, I decided to leave the last feedback because I was irritated that the replacement didn't even last that long. Well Anker emailed me again and one thing I can be certain to say is that their customer service is extremely great. My recent cable, the black one, broke and they immediately offered to ship a new one, this time I got the red like I originally had purchased and even better, the micro usb end seems much thicker and sturdier this time around.

I never used LOCA before, so having two tube's worth was much appreciated.<br /><br />Product's low viscosity made application easy, but the poor plunger did not allow for smooth dispensing.

The bad part is that it is very thin and got everywhere.<br /><br />The bubbles were easily removed with a toothpick (just poke it and the broken tension will make the bubble work itself out).<br /><br />Curing was the hard part: not sure if it is picky with wavelength or my bulb is super weak. I left the phone under a UV lamp (~340nm) for 30 minutes and nothing happened (i left a small blob near the phone as a gauge). I carefully took it out and placed it in direct sunlight: cured in about 2 minutes. Plan your work during days with bright sun, just in case.<br /><br />I like it.

5.0,"Great viewing angle, nice photo frame","I purchased this digital picture frame after already owning a 10"" Kodak one that I use at home. The Kodak is very fussy about viewing angle; if you have it tilted up or down, or you are looking at it from the side, you can play the ""what is that a picture of?"" game. I bought the Filemate Joy 15"" frame after reading a review on another site that the viewing angle was much wider. And that is correct. Plus, for the price, it is in reality twice as large as a 10"" frame in viewable inches; it's like having a 15"" flat-screen monitor with your photos on it.<br /><br />Images loaded nicely from CF and SD cards, as well as a USB flashdrive that I tried. User Interface is fairly intuitive, although it has a couple little quirks you have to get used to, to be able to save your settings. I have not tried music on the frame, as I have it on all the time at work. I run it 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, and in the 3 weeks I've had it, it has performed flawlessly. A nice feature in the settings menu is the ability to view the photos in their actual resolution. Since the frame has a native resolution of 1024x768, you can resize your images to that before you load them on the card. But if an image is not exactly that, say it is 1024x720, it will load it in that format without trying to stretch or crop it.

Unfortunately, the Streetpilot does not hold map data for the entire US (requires downloads from PC for different regions), is too large to carry in a pocket, and does not have internal batteries, otherwise I would not even be considering a replacement.

You can insert a very low gauge speaker wire, so if your speaker wire is not thick enough, it will show the gap around the wire. I use original Monster wire (may be 10-gauge, still left some gap around it).<br />This is one of the low profile plugs compare with most of the long plugs at the market, you can put your speaker closer to the wall or receiver more closer to the cabinet.<br />If you are holding the plug, you can turn the tip 360 degree freely to prevent twisted wire when insert to the binding hole, but I am more concerned about any signals lost on this design, and also not tight enough in the binding hole.<br />The red/blue indicator around the bottom part of this plug is just a label (Not metal plate or printed on the product) that you can peel them out. I have one plug which label come out, I need to peel it out carefully, and re-stick it back.<br />If you notice on recent new modeled receiver, each bind hole (positive one) has its own different color to identify different position. Other thought is if Sewell provide more colored plastic rings exchangable to identify different position of the plug, then they are perfect.<br />Bottom line is these plugs are a very good and durable plugs.

5.0,Excellent Versatile Tripod,"The Zomei Q666 is an outstanding tripod that gives the best value for price. If you are looking to upgrade from a basic tripod I highly recommend purchasing the Q666 , especially if you're on a budget. The features of the tripod overcome the price tag with monopod support, adjustable legs, and the included ballhead.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The fluid ballhead is one the reasons I gravitated towards trying the Zomei Q666 and I was not disappointed. The bullhead allows you to shoot vertical and is extremely smooth to capture panoramic images or even pan during video. . The features and versatility of this tripod is by far the reason I can not recommend this enough. The twist locks for the legs are also more comfortable but this is just my own preference. The ability to switch the column to get closer shots is also extremely helpful for low angles or macro photography.<br /><br />Cons:<br />While this tripod is not made of carbon fiber it feels sturdy and is also great in terms of its weight. The only part of this tripod I would have liked to see improved is a metal plate instead of the included plastic one.<br /><br />TLDR:<br />Great tripod, no complaints, if you need a reliable tripod: this is one.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IjVx4m-oL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IjVx4m-oL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IjVx4m-oL._SL256_.jpg'}

I came across this webcam as one of the recommended ones from Amazon and while I was initially hesitant to purchase, since trying it out I must say I am pleasantly surprised. It required no drivers for my Mac or Windows which was a surprise and worked seamlessly with Slack, GoToMeeting and Zoom. Works just fine with Skype too if you are wondering. The picture looks good and the microphones are even better since I have asked my colleagues on the other end and they tell me they hear me better than when I used my laptop's mics.

I have a 14 year old NVIDIA GeForce 9500 GT with dual DVI outputs, no HDMI, on a Win10 desktop machine.  I have DVI-HDMI adapters on both outputs of the 9500 running to the first pair of KVM inputs.  I used the supplied combo cables (HDMI+USB+Audio), so USB of that cable to an open USB on the tower to provide keyboard and mouse inputs.  The second computer is a Dell work laptop.  I have the other combo cable connected between the KVM and the HDMI and USB ports of Dell docking station, and the other KVM HDMI input connected directly to the HDMI output of the laptop.  I have an old Microsoft wireless keyboard/mouse combo running from a single receiver.  At first, it wouldn't work with the receiver plugged into either the keyboard or mouse USB ports on the KVM, but then I read the instructions that said to try to USB port on the front of the KVM (labeled ""hub"") if the back ones didn't work.

Each have pluses and minuses but I have found this to work best in combination with other methods. Your success will be based on your level of patience and perseverance. On my mirrorless Sony, one or two passes does the trick. On my Nikon, it might be an hour adventure. For that, I always save the old swabs and start with one of those and some cleaning fluid for an initial pass. Then at F19, shoot at a wall with a 4 second exposure while making circles. Then you can zoom in and see any spots. Remember that the location of a spot is mirrored from when you look at the sensor. Top is bottom, left is right. On Nikon, it takes some effort.

5.0,Great Camera,"The OMD E5 M2 is a fantastic camera. Firstly is solid, metal solid, Second, its heavy yet portable. Third its an all around great stills camera. I used to have a FIRST generation 7D (when I say first, I mean I bough the number 180 from the factory) and I do not regret not carrying the big lenses and accessories around. The OMD 2 rivals my 7D and exceeded my expectations, I have to say that I was taken back by the size at first, but with the HLD-8G External Grip, Is just perfect. Pics are  sharp yet the sensor delivers an organic feel., Colors are fantastic, a bit of green but skin tones are smooth. Way too many variables and filters too play with, and Video is fantastic 1080 progressive at 77MBps. The camera delivers a clean 422 signal via HDMI, that can parallel a Sony FS100. IMO If it's pair with the right lenses, the video delivery will fool the amateur 4K lovers. Plus you get the Gimbal included in the price. Firmware updates in the horizon? I hear the sensor can deliver UHD 4k so lets see what the future brings.

4.0,"Works great, looks better","We've been very happy with the refurbished Winegard FL-55YR FlatWave Amplified Razor Thin HDTV Indoor Antenna. This antenna is a great improvement over the rabbit ears-style antenna we have used for years. It recognized several more channels at the initial scan, and reception has been far more consistent and wavers less with changes to weather or traffic. It also offers a much cleaner profile than rabbit ears, and can be placed behind a picture on the wall, hidden behind drapes, or mounted to the side of a shelf.<br /><br />My complaints are minor. A couple of 3M Command strips were included for mounting, but without any instructions. I've used Command strips enough to be familiar with how they work, but someone who hasn't might find the omission problematic. This in no way affects the quality of the antenna, but if they're being included as an added feature, they should include instructions. My only other complaint is that, depending on the angle of origination of the broadcast signal, it might be necessary to occasionally adjust the orientation of the antenna. This is terribly inconvenient if one has used the included Command strips for mounting. A better solution would be to produce the antennas with a small hole for hanging on a hook (3M includes some in the Command line). I could try to add a hole myself, but I'm disinclined to risk ruining what is otherwise a great product.",[],B00LAA45PA,B07HBHVWS5,AFJ4ABVQT5ALT4XYQ4NOP7G3Q5NA,1427297794000,2,True

5.0,Perfect for me in every way!,"I'll explain how and where I use headphones on a daily basis and how these were so perfect for me. As you will read, during my day, I rarely do not have a set on my head.<br /><br />1. AT WORK: I work in a warehouse with forklifts flying around me all day. Conventional in ear headphones were never an option as I would not be able to hear fellow employees nor would management be ok with me creating a safety hazard without being able to hear the forklifts. Although my AfterShokz came with earplugs, they totally ARE NOT necessary to use the headphones what so ever. But if you do use them, you will be able to lower the volume and save battery life.<br /><br />For years, I used a UE Boom speaker at work but I have such a wide array of music I listen to, I was limited to what I could listen to as I am sure my co workers wouldn't want to listen to Native American Love Flute music or Roger Whitaker. =P<br /><br />I wear a ball cap at work and anytime I am out of the house and I was very happy that the AfterShokz did not hinder or get in the way of the hat whatsoever.<br /><br />2. AT HOME: While at home, I spend the majority or my time in front of the PC or TV. The AfterShokz attached via bluetooth flawlessly to both. I own 4 sets of bulky over ear headphones I use for the PC and TV but there are times I want to lie on the couch with the side of my head on a pillow. With the bulky headphones, I feel like I've rested my head on a basketball and it is very uncomfortable and headache inducing if done for too long. The AfterShokz are so slim and form fitting, I do not even know they are there while laying my head on side while on the couch.<br /><br />I honestly could not be happier with these. I am thinking of buying a second pair so I always have a charged one to turn to. Though the battery life is crazy, crazy long. Much longer then all of my bulky, retired headphones. As an example, today I listened to music at work for 8 hours. Then came home and had them on all afternoon while watching tv and the message to charge them just chimed in for a total of about 11 hours of use per charge.",[],B07RRQ59JR,B08BG7J2MN,AFURVO2PUJDIFSU3UPKHWDYHXUFQ,1628211872681,0,True

3.0,"Too big for large man, hub does loosen on camera","This is well made.  Biggest complaint is that it is too large.  I'm 6'3&#34; and over 200 lbs.  The shoulder and waist straps are tightened as far as they go and it is still a bit loose.  I would think it would be sloppy loose on a smaller person. The camera with my 100-400 mm lens pulls the harness down.  It's very hard to put on and adjust  without help.  The waist straps tighten from the back and are nearly impossible for the wearer to pull tight.<br />The camera &#34;bolt&#34; is black, powder-coated aluminum, not plastic such as everyone told  be the received when asked on the forum.  Never got a response from the seller.<br />I gotten a chance to go for a few hour hike with this.  I wore it over some fairly heavy clothing which allowed for it to fit a little tighter.  This may not as good in warmer weather when I've got light clothing on.<br />There have been complaints about the hub bolt coming loose from the camera.  I actually had this problem quite far into my hike.  It loosened and if the hub gets sideways, the camera get locked in the won't come out without twisting it to line up the exit slot.  I will work with it a little to see if I can make it stay.  Good reason to have the little &#34;screw driver&#34; attached to the harness.

4.0,"Stylish and comfy, but breaks easily!","I really wanted to like these. In fact, I did like them... for about a month. And then they broke. One of the sides where you adjust the size split in two because it is made of plastic. We weren't rough with using them and the break wasn't a result of mis-use. They literally just snapped one day when we were adjusting the size. It's a total bummer because my son loved wearing them while they lasted and they were very comfortable for him. Two stars for style, comfort, and the fact that the cord doesn't tangle and can be switched to either side of the headphones. I wish these would have worked out for us.<br /><br />EDIT: I am editing my review from 2 stars to 4, because the company did reach out to me and sent a new pair of headphones which seem to be holding up well. We've only been using them for a couple weeks and hope they hold up better than the first pair. I will update my review if any other issues arise.",[],B00Q3I690I,B0BM5353Z3,AH4HSST2WTJBMVMWJLXRFBSDEI5Q,1452290031000,1,True
5.0,Way better than I expected,"These are way nicer than I expected.  I purchased a pair of $175 earbuds and lost one of them, and found out I could not purchase just one earbud as a replacement, so decided to go with a cheap replacement pair while I searched for the missing ear bud.  I got these, and I was blown away by how nice they are.  I am sure that they are not as technically perfect sounding as the $175 earbuds I used to have, but for my purposes of wearing them while working in the yard or exercising, I could not tell a difference.  I guess that if I sat quietly in a room and listened hard enough I could tell a difference, but it would be hard.  In the real world, when you are wearing earbuds while doing stuff, these are essentially the same as top line non-sound cancelling earbuds.  These do a good job blocking ambient noise, but do not actively block sounds - my Bose noise cancelling earbuds are still the best at that, but they cost about $300.  For passive sound blocking, these are very good, and are comfortable and stay securely in my ears.  Also, the bluetooth range seemed better, and you can use either the left or right earbud separately, which is great for jogging or anything when you want to remain aware of people around you.  My more expensive pair had only one primary earbud, and when I lost it I could no longer use the other one.  With these, you can use either one.  Also, the wireless charging of the case is great.  Overall, these are an excellent value, and I could go through 5 pairs of these and still be ahead of where I was with the more expensive pair.  After living with these for several months, I came to realize I had been ripped off - not by these earbuds, but by the expensive pair:  they were not even remotely 5 times better than these earbuds.  While I am mad that I lost the expensive earbud, I no longer miss them - these earbuds are probably 90% as good for a tiny fraction of the price. Once these wear out, or I lose them, I will buy more.  They sound great, work well, and are cheap enough that I am not paranoid about losing them.

4.0,Good Design And Protection,"A good case is a ""must have"" item for any computer tablet. I find this one to be well built, to be sized well for a 7 inch tablet, and to have great padding, but to be a bit lacking in protection.<br /><br />This case is a soft padded design; there is no hard shell at all. It has a zipper which goes up and down across the top and then about 3/4 of the way down the side. This is sufficient to extract and store the tablet, but if you like complete access you may want one that goes all the way around the side. The single side zipper compartment is a bit small except for perhaps some earphones. The zippers were all easy to pull, and the seams well stitched; the case is well constructed.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like - and this is a personal preference - is that there is no hardness to the case. That means that if dropped, the tablet is exposed to the full force of the drop. The fabric and padding of this case will somewhat protect the tablet, but not as well as a hard sided case. However, it is lighter in weight than a hard sided case.<br /><br />Summary: If you like a softer, well padded case, this is it.

5.0,I &lt;3 My Camera,"I ordered the Canon SD550 right before my vacation and I am sooo happy with my purchase! It is my first digital camera, and although I am your avg point and shoot tourist, I wanted the option of being able to take nice pics using special features.<br /><br />At first I tried looking for a silver-colored camera, which you can get on other sites, but learned that these cameras are manufactured overseas and are intended for international sale only. Therefore, the silver ones are not covered under the Canon USA warranty. So I ordered mine from Amazon and yes, its Champagne color, but its nicer than I expected. In fact, you probably won't even notice the color after you realize what a great camera it is so who cares.<br /><br />The 2.5 LCD screen is great! My friend has the SD100, and the LCD looks puny by comparison. Plus the SD100 and SD550 are practically the same size. I love the fact that the LCD is huge. Definitely get an LCD protector, you can order one for $8 (incl. S/H) from Da Protector website. With the protector, I am not worried at all about damage to the LCD screen. Its pretty solid and scratch-resistant (however, not dust-resistant, so when you're putting the protector on, try to do so in a relatively dust-free environment, otherwise there will be some dust in btwn the protector and the screen).<br /><br />I also ordered the Accessory 2 Kit package from Amazon, which comes with a case and an extra battery (good price, b/c the price of just an extra battery alone is the same, so you might as well go for the case too). You will probably need the extra battery if you are going overseas and don't have an adapter. The battery that the camera comes with is said to last over 100 pics at high resolution. While on vacation (for a week), I charged the battery only once (just in case, but it never reached low), and I probably didn't need to at all. My friend's SD100 battery had to be recharged daily. I was able to take about 160 pics on 1GB memory card (mostly all on the highest resolution, however, probably could've taken more if I didn't take some video clips--about 5). The video feature is great. Not sure how long you can record but one of my clips was over 2 minutes and replaying them on the LCD screen was almost like having a mini TV with me. The sound quality is decent too, but its really a digital camera, not a video camera, so don't expect much.<br /><br />I love the features, it took me about a day to get used to them though. The My Colors features allows you to emphasize certain colors, which I liked, especially for scenic pics. The Macro features lets you take great pictures of anything close up. The Night Feature helpd a lot for sunrises and sunsets. The Stitch Feature (for panaromic use) is kinda difficult to use, you will have to match your pics up on the software and I am lazy and didn't use it. There are a ton of other features, but as long as you play around with it a bit, you'll figure it out.<br /><br />The flap for the USB connector seems kinda weak, I was afraid it would break, but perhaps it was designed this way to appear flimsy but its not? You also need to take out the battery to charge, but honestly, its not really a big deal.<br /><br />So, was my money worth spent? I believe so, considering I am hoping this camera will last me the next 5 years.<br /><br />I know people like lists so here's mine:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-Large LCD screen. Once you see it, you can't get anything less.<br /><br />-Easy to use features (after you get used to it)<br /><br />-Can take over 300 pics on 1GB at highest resolution with NO VIDEO CLIPS. I think when I first set my camera up with nothing taken yet, it was at 323 available pics. So just think how many pics you can take at just medium quality, which is just as good!<br /><br />-If you take a picture of something on portrait view (as opposed to the usual landscape view), it will rotate itself to also show portrait view on the camera.<br /><br />-Battery is strong. Its been 4 days since I charged my camera and still haven't seen low battery message yet. And I've used it to take pics, and to view playbacks many, many times.<br /><br />-Takes gorgeous pics! Everyone said I didn't need anything over 5 pix but I love how sharp my pics came out.<br /><br />-Camera starts up very quickly<br /><br />-You can take continuous pics by setting it to this mode and just keeping your finger on the button (maybe a half sec delay in btwn shots?)<br /><br />-Although it was hard for me to switch from a regular camera to digital, I am soooo happy i did because I can preview the pics and delete the ones that I don't really like, rather than waste a lot of film.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-Definitely need to buy LCD protector and a larger memory card<br /><br />-Battery needs to be taken out to charge, but I don't really find it a problem, some others may<br /><br />-The case does scratch easily, although most of the time I had it in the case, there are a few faint marks on the front<br /><br />-USB cover seems weak, but haven't had any problems so far<br /><br />-When you zoom in on video, it looks grainy. I think it may be because the pixels on the LCD are not enough? I think the SD550 and SD500 have the same amount of pixels, but the SD 550 just has a bigger size screen.<br /><br />-For some reason, I was unable to transfer 1 video clip to my computer. I am not sure why. this is the one that was over 2 minutes.",[],B000AYKUUQ,B000AYKUUQ,AE7J4Z276T24I7KBDGNWZAJGANOQ,1128978024000,59,True

5.0,"Easy to set up and use (on a Mac, anyway)","This is, essentially, a web-cam with magnification and manual focus. The stand makes it easy to position the camera and to 'zoom' the picture (by raising and lowering the whole scope).<br />The built-in light does a fine job of illuminating most subject (and has three levels), but you might want to use external illumination for certain shots (such as when the subject is reflective or when relief needs to be captured; I provided an example).<br />I followed the instructions (for Macs) and used the PhotoBooth app to take these pictures. That app previews only in mirror-mode, which is somewhat annoying, but the pictures can come out right-way-round if you set it to 'auto-flip' the results. Any Mac app that can see the internal camera can see this one when it is attached. You could find another option if the mirroring drives you nuts.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718EgiTvvpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718EgiTvvpL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718EgiTvvpL._SL256_.jpg'}

So much for its ""vaunted"" battery life.  If I read one(1) book, approx 350 pages, battery goes from 100% to approx 65%.  And yes, WiFi is turned off the whole time.  So I can only read approx 2 books per full charge.<br /><br />Love the digital books we have access to in the 21st century, has saved me a lot of room in my house since it's already full of bookcases.<br /><br />HATE getting a new Kindle, won't ever upgrade again.  Wouldn't have done it again this time if I hadn't wanted page-turn buttons so badly (I hate touch screen for page turning).  I have NEVER had a problem-free experience getting a new Kindle and trying to download my library.  I have approx 1600 books and I just bought a 32gb Oasis.  Just like with the last Kindle I bought, approx 20-30% of the books won't download, no matter what I try, plus other errors.  I've also seen this complaint from others.<br /><br />Amazon engineers need to figure out what the problem is, rather than putting the burden on the user to spend days & weeks trying to get access to a library of books we've paid them for.  There is a complete lack of progress on resolving these ongoing problems trying to download libraries to a new device.  Jeff Bezos can put humans in space but his company can't deliver the library I paid them for to my Kindle device?!  Seriously?!<br /><br />You can only transfer books from the cloud to your Kindle by:<br />1)  From your contents page, can only SELECT ALL for up to 25 books at a time, per page, to deliver to your device.  I have 1587 books, which equals 64 pages of books, so I have to do this 64 times.  And 20-30% of these won't actually download!  Will deliver the ""book cover"" to your device, but the actual book won't open.<br />2)  You can download a book to your PC and transfer via USB, but you can only do ONE book at a time!  And the failed download via Whisper Sync will still show on your device, so now you have two(2) books showing on the device but only one will open.  And no way to get that failed download book cover off your device, since the Remove Download option doesn't show/work for a book that didn't actually download!!<br /><br />At least give us an option to download and transfer via USB my entire cloud library, or 25 at a time, to my PC so I can copy/paste to my Kindle via USB.  This method actually does deliver them to my Kindle device, whereas the Whisper Sync won't download large portions of books to a new Kindle device, just book covers with no book there to open.",[],B07GRSK3HC,B07RJZPTLX,AGNJAGHENK57HWBV5W4QMD62E2NQ,1666582111427,4,True

So we looked for something more rugged, without LCD screens (which is what broke on our previous radios). These radios look great and are loaded with features. We haven’t tried using them at a crowded event yet, but we have used them to communicate in and around our neighborhood, and they have worked well for that.<br /><br />Operation is really simple - there are two dials on the top of the radio next to the antenna. One is a continuous dial for volume. The other is a discrete switch to switch between channels. The push to talk button is on the side of the radio next to the antenna. The opposite side has the ports for mic and headset. One orange button is for the flashlight, while the other one is for monitor / squelch.<br /><br />Family radio services - FRS - all share the same 22 12.5 khz channels as other general mobile radio services (GMRS). 7 of these are lower power (0.5W) in the 467 Mhz range and the other 15 are higher power (2W) in the 462 Mhz range. We didn’t find in the documentation which 16 of the 22 channels were included in this radio. Channel 16 is a scanning channel on this radio. So my guess is that the other 15 are the 2W / 462 Mhz channels corresponding to FRS channels 1-7 and 15-22, and that channel 16 is scanning FRS channels 8-14. But I could be wrong. We received random radio traffic on channel 1, so I assume that they are using the standard FRS channels.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Both radios worked out of the box. They lasted several hours on standby with occasional bursts of discussion up to about a mile away<br />- After getting a full charge, the radios lasted about 2.5 days on standby with occasional bursts of discussion<br />- Charging was relatively quick - can be fully charged in a few hours<br />- Both radios had fully functional switches, buttons, ports, indicator lights, and flashlights. There was no damage from shipping to the radio housing or the antennas<br />- The headset / microphone worked well and fit someone with a smaller ear canal without any discomfort<br />- The radios are compact - about the size of a soda can<br />- Voice notification when you switch channels so you don’t have to try and read the dial (which wouldn’t be visible in low light anyways)<br />- They look like professional radios, and the clip is very sturdy<br />- Speaker is plenty loud enough to hear in a crowd<br /><br />Cons or areas to improve:<br />- The clips and lanyards had to be attached after arrival. I think these are typically desired / essential for the way most people use walkie-talkies and should come pre-installed to reduce setup time<br />- The headset / mic connection are hidden behind a rubber flap to protect the ports. If you use these radios with the mic / headset constantly connected, you will have a large rubber flap protruding from the unit…that will look a bit unprofessional<br />- The handset announces “please change battery” loudly when the battery is low. That can be startling when it happens in the middle of the night.<br />- The charger is supposed to light up green when the radio is fully charged and red when charging a radio. If the charger is unplugged and the radio is plugged into it, the charger will also light up green, which is a false indicator.<br />- No battery level indicator - it can be difficult to know if you are going to have a days worth of battery left or only a few hours.<br />- Instructions don’t state which FRS channels correspond to the 15 channels on this radio<br />- Difficult to read which channel is currently selected","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710BtRBswfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710BtRBswfL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710BtRBswfL._SL256_.jpg'}

1.0,DOES NOT Work As Advertised,"Go to Logitech's Web site. Filter mice by &#34;O.S.&#34; & check the box for Linux. Eight mice will be shown supporting Linux out of the 24 total mice available. That explicitly says there is something unique about these 8 mice that earns them that status. THERE IS NOT. These mice &#34;support&#34; Linux in exactly the same way ALL Logitech mice support Linux: you plug it in and you can move the cursor on the screen and some sub-set of buttons will provide some functionality, typically left-click and right-click only. Sometimes fwd/back will work (depending upon the mouse) and rarely other functions will operate in some manner, but Logitech's Linux &#34;supported&#34; mice function in no way different than those that DON'T &#34;support&#34; Linux. I don't know if this rises to the level of an FTC complaint, but it is false & deceptive advertising at best, actionable at worst. Logitech provides no software for Linux. Logitech says they support Windows, Linux, Mac, Chrome, and Android. Sure enough, you can download software for all those O.S.s EXCEPT Linux. This is the same as saying Logitech mice supports DOS because you can rest your DOS book on the mouse. That's not the kind of &#34;support&#34; people mean when they're looking for support. They mean, if you SAY you support Linux, but only with these 8 mice, that means there is something special about those mice. There isn't. I own over a dozen mice, more than half are Logitech mice. I can plug any of them into Linux and get movement & right-click, left-click, yet only ONE of those dozen says it supports Linux by the manufacturer, but you get nothing unique, special, or different from that &#34;support&#34;.<br /><br />The ergonomics, while not bad, aren't great either. I'd rate this mouse 2.5 stars for ergonomics. They aren't as bad as the MX Master's, but they're inferior to the MX Anywhere, MX Revolution, MX Performance, M705, and other Logitech mice. They ARE significantly better than a 1980's Microsoft mouse, but then that is a decades old mouse. You'd think with billions of mouse users world-wide, ergonomics would be less than &#34;second nature.&#34; The mouse is the user's most intimate physical relationship with their computer. You gotta get THAT right. There are a handful of things to make a good mouse: good hand-feel/ergonomics, the whole control-the-cursor-on-the-screen-right-click/left-click thing has to work, it shouldn't be ugly, add a couple of convenience buttons, make it so it'll last, sell it for a price that covers engineering-manufacturing-shipping-warehousing-packaging-advertising, etc. It's not rocket-science, it's basic business stuff.<br /><br />The quality of manufacturing is significantly poorer than the quality of even Logitech's cheaper mice. Logitech's high-end mice offer superior build quality, but some, like the M705, and others of the M3xx & M5xx series are cheaper AND have better build-quality than the M720 Triathlon. It looks cheap, and it feels cheap.<br /><br />The only difference supporting it's higher price is the inclusion of bluetooth. Bluetooth chips literally cost $0.01. An entire bluetooth module cost $0.10 apiece even for lots of one module. Buy 100,000, like Logitech must do, and the price is far south of $0.01. For that, Logitech charges $25. A pretty nice margin when you consider the mouse's other manufacturing costs are less than their cheaper mice.",[],B01LF37K80,B01LF37K80,AFQ54FLISLOLXO2GO4EQA5DS7GBA,1493420626000,2,True

I read before bed and like the backlit screen so that I can turn the lights off in the room and read for a while.<br /><br />Back when Barnes & Noble came out with the Nook, I bought it the second it came out.  I promptly sold it on eBay a few days later after not being happy with the ghosting I saw as I turned the pages (a light copy of the previous page could be seen on the current page).  The Paperwhite does not have that problem, thankfully.<br /><br />It's taking me a bit to get used to in terms of finding my way around since there are no buttons, but that's a user issue and not the fault of the device.  I do, however, wish the touch screen was more responsive.  I find that I have to hold something a bit longer or tap a few more times in order to get where I want to go.<br /><br />I will admit that I manually transferred things from my old Kindle to my new one and then had a panic attack when I couldn't access any of the books I'd purchased.  In the moment, it didn't dawn on me that that would be far too easy for people to give copies of the books to other people, but it was an easy fix to go into my account and send them all to my new Kindle.<br /><br />I wish the back of the device wasn't so smooth.  When holding it with one hand (I hold it on the side), I find that my fingers slip.  I'll be getting a case for it so it won't matter, but some might not want a case so a textured back may aid in preventing slippage.<br /><br />All in all, I really like it and am glad I made the upgrade.",[],B00OQVZDJM,B00OQVZDJM,AFQSE62D3NUSJ3FWHLHKIQ7VVIZQ,1474762792000,0,True

So, I got ahold of Amazon and they refunded my money. Then I got ahold of the people that I had the 2 yr warranty and got a full refund. I will not buy another chromebook. Just not happy with that situation.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch of them, but I wasn't willing to try a replacement. I didn't care for the size of it.

The playlist shuffle mode does not have a no-repeat option, so you may get the same song multiple times.

I think I'll just return the EVOPlus, leave the existing M.2 with Win10Pro alone as my boot drive, and just physically move my old computer's 1TB HD and 2.5"" 256GB SSD, making real short work of moving data with a screwdriver instead of an external drive or cable.<br /><br />They lost a Star on my review as there wasn't a SD Media Reader as Pictured on the front of the case, and there was No Mouse or Keyboard (sending me frantically scrambling thru my dead H/W pile) or WiFi Dongle in the box when it arrived, even though they are all pictured/listed in the product description.

Giving them back the 5th Star on my review, as we all make mistakes but its how you recover from them that determines ultimate customer satisfaction<br /><br />Remember the DELL Optiplex 7040 was designed to be a top tier Business Desktop, not a prebuilt gaming rig, if you are going to install a powerful GPU, its going to take more power than the OEM 240w power supply has to spare, and I'm afraid even a card that doesnt require a power cable, like a GTX1030, is going to stress the power supply more than its worth over the onboard Intel 530 graphics that can already drive 3 monitors.  To upgrade the Power Supply, you won't find the same long rectangular Dell form factor that will just clip into the case, you'll have to modify the case by drilling new holes in the sheet metal to bolt in a regular square style ATX PSU. I don't play games enough to justify that effort or expense as the onboard Intel 530 GPU rates higher on the old WEI, a 7.7, limited by the desktop graphics and Graming Graphics ratings, than my older PC that has a GT 240 video card but only got a 4.7 limited by Desktop Graphics, even though it gets a 9.9 on 3D Graphics and Gaming<br /><br />Hope the review and attached pictures answer your questions about what's inside the box given a few inaccuracies in the product description regarding RAM, SSD, and included accessories","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71es2rwlZ3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71es2rwlZ3L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71es2rwlZ3L._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,For every music lover and audiophile,"Every music lover needs to upgrade to these cables.

I also own all high end dac/amps, dacs, and stand alone amps. The quality of the materials and workmanship is also exquisite. I got the 4ft version with 3.5mm plugs since I do most of my listening on one hour plus walks with my dog in the evening. You just contact them through their Amazon email and they’ll customize the cable to your needs 100%. They also ship within a day or two but since the cables come from China, it takes about two to three weeks.

5.0,Incredible TV.  There is no other TV like it (except another OLED),"This is an amazing TV.  Purchased during the Thanksgiving flash sale to replace a 65"" TCL R6 which was previously serving as the bedroom TV.  I've been eyeing the OLEDs in stores for a couple years, but from a value/cost perspective, the TCL was the winner.  Until this deal.  The R6 was great.  This OLED is significantly better.  Only bad thing I have to say is about the delivery.  Purchased the deluxe delivery, unpack and setup through Amazon, and the (third party company called XPO) delivery guys refused to do anything other than drop off the sealed TV box and leave.  They weren't very nice about it, even when I showed them my phone.  Called Amazon to complain, and Amazon made it right, but the TV was fun to set up (fragile, awkward and heavy).  Fortunately, we didn't break it!  Once we got it set up though, it's Amazing.  Best picture quality of any TV I have ever owned.  Checked the model/serial numbers, and this TV has the evo panel that LG is putting in the C2 (although this is a C1).  This is a nice free upgrade, as the evo panel is supposed to be more resistant to burn-in.  Overall, I'm very happy with this TV, and with the way Amazon took care of the delivery problem when I made them aware of it.  0-stars for the third-party delivery service XPO, but 5-stars for the TV itself, and for Amazon CS.",[],B08WG4HKKY,B09GQJ1RR7,AH6JRQM5ZCIRWMDYJULGI7G66SRA,1671862525632,6,True

But I noticed in the first few months sometimes it would restart randomly, very randomly.<br />This was then followed by perhaps half a year into it where the when the REAR cam would bug the ENTIRE cam causing it to turn off and not be able to start up properly until I disconnected the rear cam cord. However, after waiting a few hours, Reconnecting it the rear cam would cause no issues. BUT, sometimes it would happen again. And now in Apr 2023, I am writing this a bit more than a year after buying this to say that the entire dash cam is now useless. I checked the cables, no faulty wiring. I even tried 2 different SD cards and formatted them, didn't solve it. Firmware checked as well, nothing. I am now stuck with a dash cam that keeps turning on and off for the entire time.

4.0,Replacement works great,"The camera worked out of the box fine.  However, after only a few hours of initial use, the device would not power back on.  The reset button did not work or appear to affect anything.  I will add that the video quality was very good and the wide angle camera has a good field-of-vision.  I have returned the device and was refunded immediately (Amazon is great!).  It may be that I got a defective unit, but I can't say for sure.  Two final items: (1) due to the orientation of the camera the power cable jack is 'upside down' and seems to put undue stress on the power cable & (2) the adhesive camera mount is very sturdy, but you only get one mount and double-sided sticker; perhaps they should provide more than 1 sticker?  What if you get a new car?  Assuming the device lasted for more than 3 hours, what if the adhesive wears out?<br />UPDATED REVIEW 8/10/18: Rexing offered me a replacement unit.  The new camera works fine.  I've had it for a while now and it continues to work well.  Even if I forget to remove the camera from it's mount when I park for an extended period, it seems unaffected by the FL sun/heat.  My only minor complaint is the adhesive mount.  It allows the camera to be flush against the windshield, but I wish they would send an extra adhesive.  At some point, it will need to be replaced.  Other than that, the recording quality is good, wide-angle lens captures a lot and the power cable is holding up.",[],B00X528FNE,B09WRF4Y6G,AEDWMJLKI42M6A6QIONL3DT56CCA,1470835401000,2,True

1.0,Both have quit working.,"I purchased two of these back in June of 2022. I did not realize when i ordered them that the outlets at the end of the cord all had a seperate button to turn each one on and off. No big deal, right? Wrong. They worked great for about a week. Then they started acting up.  If you even looked at the buttons too hard the outlets shut off. Now here we are, middle of august, and neither one of the cord reels will turn on. Power going in to each of them, but no power coming out and when you push any of the power buttons on the end of cord, none of the 6 led lights come on indicating its working. I was able to get the one reel to work after aggressively shaking the end of it, but it only stayed on for about 5 minutes before acting up again. End of the day, i do not recommend buying these. I am going to file for a refund or cut the ends off and add standard cord ends.",[],B07ND2Y9LS,B07ZPFLSVF,AFGZAVDHA7OQVJUPLU4PKQM55J7Q,1661869480737,1,True

3.0,What I was looking for in a fitness tracker!,"I previously bought a Lintelek fitness tracker thinking that if it didn't work too great, I can give it to one of my kids. Well, it didn't work too great for heart rate monitoring, but is good enough to give a person interest in fitness, so I gave it to my kids. I then ran across the Amazefit Bip and read through the reviews more carefully. My main concerns where the Lintelek fell short were:<br />1- Screen brightness for outdoors viewing while running<br />2- Heart rate monitor accuracy (don't need medical grade, but accurate enough to rely on for training zones)<br />3- Built-in GPS, though not a deal breaker since I find that I can get pretty close using an average stride length<br /><br />The screen on the Bip is excellent. It kind of uses natural daylight to reflect and enhance your ability to see the screen without backlight. The automatic backlighting when turning your wrist makes it easy to see in the dark, though it doesn't stay on quite as long as I'd like (only about 3 seconds). If you push the side button, it turns the backlight on for more like 7 or 8 seconds which is plenty. The screen is really excellent and I only keep it at about 60% brightness.<br /><br />The heart rate monitor is very good in my testing vs. a Polar FT4 with chest strap monitor. The best way to describe the data is accurate, but smoothed out since it seems to be slightly more averaged. For example, if I have a peak of 145bpm visible on the Polar, but only for a moment, it won't show up on the Bip quite as high. The Bip is more like an average of every 2 or 3 seconds, while the Polar is more like a 1 second average. Those may not be exactly accurate specs, but that's just the best way I can describe what I see when comparing the two. If you are doing an activity where the effort is pretty level, both the Bip and the Polar ready around +/- 2 bpm, sometimes the Bip is higher and sometimes it is lower. Most of the time, the difference is that the Bip is a little delayed, so the Polar will go up and then the Bip will go up, or the Polar will go down and then the Bip will go down. That's something I noticed with the Lintelek as well, though the Lintelek was way off on the actual number shown where the Bip is very close most of the time. I don't think there is any doubt that the Polar is a better heart rate monitor, but the Bip is not so significantly off that I wouldn't trust it to help me stay in a specific training zone. It just seems to be close enough and the fact that it is paired with a phone app to process the data (the Polar can really only be viewed on the watch face) makes it immediately more useful. Add to that the GPS function, and it is a more advanced overall package for sure.<br /><br />The GPS is a little slow to acquire a signal, but does work. I've never used a GPS watch and I can't compare it to anything, but the GPS takes around 10 seconds at minimum and sometimes longer before it is connected. Once it is, it seems to be fine. Not having to bring my phone along on a run to get GPS data is very nice. I can't say how reliable the data is yet, but I suspect it's good enough for the average person to use for fitness purposes and probably suffers from the same problems in areas with bad signals as any other GPS device.<br /><br />I didn't have much trouble with the app and find it to be OK. It does take about 10-20 minutes to set up the watch due to installation of updates to firmware and other things that need to be uploaded to the watch from the phone. The process went smoothly for me with a Samsung Galaxy S7. Just to clarify, I installed the app before trying to connect to the watch. Once the app was in, it took a couple of minutes for the app to find and connect to the phone. Once that initial connection was made, I have not had to do anything for reliable syncing. I can come and go from my phone and the watch/phone will reconnect each time I am close enough for a connection.<br /><br />Overall, the Bip seems to be a great fitness tracker, even before you take the price into account. I think people get caught up in the ""steps"" or other somewhat arbitrary measurements  like sleep tracking as if they can possible be accurate. I'm not sure how accurate those are on the Bip, but my thinking as it relates to step counting and sleep measurement is that the device is the same from one day to the next, so if you are improving your number from day to day, it is improving regardless. If you were switching between step counters daily, it would be impossible to know where you are at, but if you use the same device day to day, it seems that you will know how one day relates to the next, which to me is the whole point of the fitness tracking part.<br /><br />Where I think there should be less room for error is when you are dealing with heart rate monitoring. It can be counter productive to be in the wrong heart rate zone depending on what you are trying to accomplish for that day, so some degree of reliable precision is necessary there. In my tests vs. a reliable chest based electric signal sensor (considered more accurate than the optical these trackers have), the measurements taken by the Amazefit Bip are very close, just missing those instantaneous peaks and valleys that are not relevant to zone training anyways. If I want to run between 140 and 165, I'm fairly confident that the monitor on the Bip is going to keep me in a real world 140-165 where the Lintelek would have been unknowingly pushing me over 165 at times but at other times potentially undertraining  below 140 as well. In my opinion, the Bip is definitely reliable for heart rate monitoring in a training environment.<br /><br />This is an excellent product and a great value! I'll update if there are problems.<br /><br />Update: After more testing, I find that the heart rate monitor is still OK, but occasionally seems to be on the low side (around one workout per week). In those cases, a run that I know would be at around 160 ends up closer to 145. Most of the time it is pretty close and for runs where the heart rate is a little slower (140 or less), it is usually right on. Not perfect, but it's pretty good and the other features of the watch make it worth being patient with an occasional glitchy HR.<br /><br />Update 4/20: The HR monitor has progressively become less and less reliable to the point of being useless for workouts. It has not performed properly for a workout in a long time. I have tried cleaning the watch thoroughly prior to a workout with no change in results. Compared to my Polar H1 and a newer Polar H10, any HR that is above 130 is pretty inaccurate on the Bip. Any HR over 150 usually drops to read way too low.  If all you do is hard walks, it will work fine. If you want to track actual activities, the Bip just doesn't live up to modest expectations. I've removed a star from my original review. The general fitness tracking in terms of steps, etc. are useful and I think it's a good watch, but it isn't a good HR monitor at all.",[],B07CRSK5DM,B07CRSK5DM,AGHYPRFVR6VA5VO3MPJAOH6DMG5A,1556411049203,2,True

I bought a new HDMI cord, tried changing HDMI ports on the TV, checked Denon's site and learend how to reset the receiver, and eventually switched TVs, trying to troubleshoot the issue.

1.0,Major issue with this burner,"Buyer beware if you attempt to copy digital 8 tape from your camcorder using i-link to this burner.<br /><br />I bought this burner with the goal of coverting all my digital 8 tapes to DVD using the i-link.  What I discovered is that this burner automatically goes to pause if there is even the slightest gap on the tape you are trying copy.  In order to start recording again you must physically press the record button again to start recording.  If your tape has quite a few gaps -- which many home videos have, you will have to sit next to this burner and press record everytime it pauses.  Bottom line to burn a DVD with this unit you have to sit next to it for the entire hour to make sure it does not stop -- unless your output take is well edited with no gaps at all.<br /><br />I contacted Sony technical support on this issue and they admitted that the pausing of the burner using i-link because of tape gaps was a ""design flaw"" that had no remedy.  Furthermore they had fielded many calls on this exact issue with their only suggestion to attempt to return the burner to the vendor.<br /><br />If you are not going to use this burner with i-link and a camcorder then I guess you are ok.  Unless you have perfect output tape with no gaps, you are in for a frustrating experience using this burner.

Picture quality (blacks and 3D)<br />3. Smart TV apps (Netflix looks great over WIFI)<br />4. Exterior design (Slim and looks expensive)<br />5. Sports channels displaying full 1080i look great<br />6. Wifi Remote<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Light reflection of matte screen<br />2. Adhesive left behind on front frame from packaging difficult to come off.<br /><br />Overall this TV is awesome and worth the price but what I noticed above everything is the deep blacks and how good full 1080p and 3D looks. Keep in mind that not all channels in your cable TV are pushing full 1080p resolution so as you flip through the channels you will notice some channels better than others. I also found out the UVerse boxes only support up to 720i but if you watching a Blu-ray movie looks amazing. Netflix started offering Super HD and it too looks stunning. When watching action movies don't expect the internal speakers to satisfy Movie Theater experience, for that you need a decent surround system with a good subwoofer. My only complaint is the inferred remote has to be pointed at the lower left corner until they upgrade the firmware so it can be used over WIFI.<br /><br />Update 8-5-14: a few months back they release an update for the WIFI remote so it works.

4.0,"Decent splitter, but the connection gets glitchy every few days","Installation is just a matter of plugging in the HDMI cables for the 2 items you're switching between, then a third to connect the adapter to the screen you're switching on.<br /><br />HDMI cables are NOT included with this, so make sure you have 3 high-quality, reliable cables to use. In my case, I've been using the same cables for about a year with no issues, so I had faith they'd continue to work well with this.<br /><br />For the most part they do! Every few days, though, the thing gets pretty glitchy and it's almost like it gets itself confused with trying to switch between inputs (even though I haven't pushed the switch button). I usually resolve it by just unplugging and replugging the HDMI cables and it's good for a few days.<br /><br />Picture quality is really decent. I work in creative, so I spend a lot of time reviewing and editing design assets. Haven't had any concerns with color quality or strange granularity since I started using this.<br /><br />Switching inputs is literally just a matter of pressing the little button on the top of the adapter.

5.0,Totally pleased with Nikon D40X,"I really wanted the D80. I've had a Nikon F, a Nikon FE and a Nikon Coolpix 4500 (among other brands) over the years. But when my husband decided that HE'D ""like to get back into photography"" and that we ought to get the D40X first, then he'd take it when I was ""ready"" for the D80, I decided that was a good way to go. And I've been thrilled with the choice because it's really the perfect 'entry level' camera for me. While I can hardly wait to move up to the D80, the D40X has been great for both of us. It's a grab-and-go camera he took to grandson's school event and, never having touched it, took some great photos. I've taken some of the best ""people"" pictures of my life--the first week I had it! It's light and small enough for me to take pictures off the back of a Honda ST-1300/Oan-European, one of my favourite things to do. Best of all, SOME of my old Nikkor lenses work with it (most of the others can be modified) so I am using a 20+ year-old 35-135 Nikkor AF Zoom and, even though I have to focus it myself, I find I am taking my best photos with it and often it's the lens on the camera till I get a newer, longer lens. I was truly surprised at how well soccer photos came out--not all in focus because I haven't had to focus a camera for decades! So I just took more shots and threw out all the fuzzies. If you're moving up to DSLR from either the SLR or the Digital world, this is an excellent way to make the move. And if you have old Nikon mount lenses, don't count 'em out! They might weigh more (they do, they do!) but don't throw them away. They're still the greatest!",[],B000NOEDGK,B000OAH338,AHYBJG7MECXXRGMLWCSY5KSGQA6Q,1207750505000,1,True

I carried this setup the whole day for my kids' birthday party. My neck was only slightly sore at the end of the day from the weight.<br /><br />I have to occasionally tight the screw in the bottom of the camera, but I've gotten in the habit where every time I take it out of the bag, I twist it. Now I don't even realize I do it. My only other gripe is the strap doesn't seem to slip through the neck padding very easy.

5.0,Excellent and works with the iPod first gen too,"Advertised also as a cover, be aware that it is a substitute for Apple's official cover, and only protects the iPads' screen side (the automatic on/off works just the same).  Because the first gen iPad is a little bit larger and thicker than the second generation, the keyboard case does not fit in the iPad 1. I tried the Bluetooth connection with my old iPad first generation, and the keyboard works just fine. I also tried to connect with my later generation iPod but it wouldn't recognize the Logitech keyboard.<br /><br />The product comes with a conventional QWERTY keyboard plus dedicated keys for picture slideshow and music controls, and cut/copy/paste keys. These additional keys come very handy, but for complete operation you still need to touch the screen, and particularly navigating from one app to another, or within an app is limited (the tab key works mostly for jumping fields when typing). You can position your iPad horizontally or vertically, and it works just fine.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the Logitech Keyboard Case a lot and I think it is a good investment if you do a lot of typing from your iPad. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a keyboard case that also provides protection for both the front and back sides of the iPad, and available for both iPad generations, before deciding take a look at [[ASIN:B0043TB9D6 Kensington KeyFolio Bluetooth Keyboard and Case for iPad 1, K39294US (Black)]] and [[ASIN:B0054L7FVW Kensington Apple iPad 2 KeyFolio Pro Performance Case with wireless Bluetooth keyboard for Apple iPad 2 3G Tablet, WIFI Model, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB with different adjustable angles]].",[],B0054JE706,B0054JE706,AEOWNJIMSHPIIMGE2KXHHEPOFF5A,1316738473000,12,False
4.0,"Throw away the included RCA to 3.5mm adapter, and enjoy!!!","I bought two sets used - like new, one for me, and one for my wife. They came in original box with original packing, and were in perfect condition. However, I am glad I had a chance to read through some of the reviews here before I purchased these, or these great headphones would have been going back.<br /><br />I started off by using the included adapter and there was a constant noise on the head phones, and it was at a level that was not easy to ignore. I swapped out the junk adapter with a good one, and the sound was mostly clear. I put on something that had straight dialogue, and there was a hint of static before and after someone was talking. When I tested the second set, it was perfect, and I tested the first one again, and the problem had disappeared. Also, my blackberry cause interference on channel 2.<br /><br />In order to have both sets on the same input you can use one base as the transmitter, and have both tuned to that base, or use a Y-adapter to connect both sets to the same output. I went with the Y-adapter, because the transmitter/charger base does not transmit while the set is charging. Basically if you wanted to just use one set, you would have to make sure to grab the correct one, or the audio would not work. Not a huge issue, but I thought I would just avoid it by using a stereo y-adapter.<br /><br />I have heard of issues with the batteries, but I have not had them long enough to speak to this. If I do have any trouble I will just get [[ASIN:B0030T1NEU AmazonBasics AAA NiMH Precharged Rechargeable Batteries-4-Pack, 800 mAh]] to replace the cells in the battery packs. However, my wife and I are not likely to spend more than a few hours at a time using these.<br /><br />Pros: Great sound for a great price (used like new $25)<br />  Easy to set up - except for the bad adapter<br />Cons: They went to cheap on their adapter, and made a great product sound bad.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you do not mind swapping out the junk adapter for a quality one, and possibly buying new battery cells to replace the originals these are a great high quality 5 star set of headphones!!!!!  If you try to use them with the adapter that comes in the box, they are not really all that great... maybe 3 star at best.

1.0,"Poor Performer, Terrible Audio Quality, No Stereo","This device is a great idea but fails to satisfy its intended purpose...to provide reliable quality audio in your car from your Sansa player.<br /><br />I live in the Los Angeles area so finding an unused FM frequency is nearly impossible. Practically every possible FM frequency has some signal on it which makes this device useless for metropolitan use. I did find 1 frequency in the 88 MHz range that did work BUT I had to run a small wire from my external auto antenna to sit in close proximity to the iTrip in order to get any audio. Without this extra wire, the audio I did get was terrible. Repositioning the iTrip helped a little but never made the audio worth listening to. I have 2 cars (1 with an external whip antenna and 1 with a hidden antenna). The iTrip failed to work adequately in both vehicles.<br /><br />Additionally, it is nearly impossible to get enough signal from this device to allow for FM stereo reception by my car radios. 90% of the time, my FM receiver would only pickup a mono signal. Yes, I did change the LX/DX setting on both the iTrip as well as my car stereo.<br /><br />I used the iTrip over the past week on a trip to Arizona.

5.0,Nice keyboard,"I've been enjoying this for a while now. I was a bit dubious considering some of the other reviews, but I have to say that I've been very happy with this keyboard. I work from home, so I type all day. I bought this keyboard specifically because I prefer to work in low light and I need to see the keys when typing in complex passwords and such. Also, all the other keyboards I have had had the letters rubbed off the keys. While I am comfortable touch-typing, first thing in the morning (before the coffee kicks in) I kinda need to see what I'm doing. The backlight on the keys is not at all too bright. I like that I can change between purple, blue and red.

5.0,Awesome case. Very well padded on all sides,"Awesome case.  Very well padded on all sides.  The kickstand is solid after hundred of uses.  It works well with any screen protector. Just be aware that you may have to slightly modifybthe case or screen protector in some cases.  The raised edge that protects the screen side fits snugly around the outer edge of the screen with a glass screen protector, this raised edge may overlap the edge of the screen protector slightly peeling it up around the edge.  I easily fixed this by taking a sharp blade and shaving a bit of the rubberized edge down to allow a perfect fit with the glass screen guard.  It's way simpler than it may sound and wont change the functionality of the case even if you remove the glass screen cover in the future. This is due to the snug yet rubbery grip the entire case has on the whole device. It does add some weight to the device, but its well worth the peace of mind i have carrying my tablet around my daily rugged work environment- Construction sites and in my backpack everywhere i go.  Also works great with the surface keyboard.

It was a most unsatisfactory experience. I spoke to several people who were either unable or unwilling to help me get a replacement that worked. They told me that this wasn't a documented problem with the item. I told them I saw two reviews on Amazon that mentioned the same issue. After much back and forth (and a whole lot of time on the phone) about a resolution, they agreed to send me a new one. That was many weeks ago. I'm still waiting... It's a shame because I think this would be a perfect way to store my phone while it charges. What is Leviton thinking? They could easily solve the problem by sending me a replacement, which would probably cost them less than $2. Instead, they generate ill will and poor ratings.

5.0,Great sound and nice fit!,"I wanted to get a better pair of headphones for my iPod, and finally decided on these after reading the other reviews.  I've had them for about 4 days, and they're great!  The sound is good, and the sound isolation is very good with the foam ear inserts.  The sound is spectacular compared to the standard earphones that come with an iPod.  And, for those of us that live in noisy urban environments, this will be a nice way to protect hearing from ambulances, subways, etc.  Therefore, the sound is better because A) you're isolated from ambient noise  and B) the headphones fit into your ear canal better, delivering clear sound better.<br /><br />I tried the two-tiered gray silicone inserts (not pictured) to start, and they were pretty good.  However, they made my inner-ear itch after a while.  I then tried the foam (which the company recommends in their instructions) and they're much more comfortable and better at isolating sound.<br /><br />However, just one note:  I did not recieve the conical-shaped inserts that these headphones are pictured with.  No big deal to me, because the cylindrical foam inserts perform very well, and come in a large and small size.<br /><br />So, considering these are only $10 more than the original iPod headphones, sound way better, and protect you from loud ambient noise (and therefore allow you to play your music at a lower level) these are a super investment!",[],B000CP2YPC,B000CP2YPC,AENFO7QG2O4LKNJO5EI64XII53LQ,1190784574000,0,True

1.0,Shoddy rip off of another product and the company has poor customer service,"Don’t be fooled by the rave reviews praising the design of this product. It’s a near complete rip off of a long time available German product called Knosti Disco Antistat. Vinyl Styl is using the exact goat hair brushes and a slightly modified clamp. Even the funnel, funnel screen and filters are identical to the Knosti. But despite the modifications, problems with the design remain. The clamps are slightly larger than the Knosti and actually cover the label fully, plus they use an o-ring rubber washer on the clamp rather than the flat rubber style of the Knosti. This all sounds good, right? Problem is that neither design truly prevents the label from getting wet. The o-ring helps but does not eliminate the problem. Plus, the latest Knosti introduced a crank design that allows the user to rotate the record without having to touch it, whereas Vinyl Styl are using the old bit by bit rotation method.<br /><br />Now, the big problem I have is their poor customer support. I purchased a unit from Amazon and received it without the brushes installed. They were tossed into the box like an afterthought, and when I put them in the unit they did not snap in or fit properly but remained very loose. When a record was pulled out of the unit, the brushes came with it. I contacted Vinyl Styl and they confirmed this was a manufacturing defect, that the brushes are supposed to be pre-installed and fit firmly. I sent the unit back to Amazon and got another, but it was from the same fulfillment center and had the same problem. Vinyl Styl said the distributor must have gotten a faulty batch. They said they would promptly send me a properly configured unit and then I would send them my defective unit. Well, that was the last I heard and follow up inquiries went unanswered, so I just sent it back to Amazon again for a refund and will do without. A shoddy ripped off design, manufacturing problems and poor customer service are not going to help Vinyl Styl’s reputation.

3.0,"Good, But Not Very Robust Design","I like the unit but had to replace it in less than 1 year.  We would transfer this unit between 3 cars.  The constant plugging and unplugging of the unit to move between cars caused wear on the wires, internal and external plugs affecting their ability to hold a connection.  This resulted in an intermittent electrical problem that caused the signal to cut in and out.  It finally got so bad we had to replace unit.  As noted in other reviews, you tend to have a tangle of wires in your car with this unit.<br /><br />Functionally, I liked this unit.

Only reason I had to buy another one is because my last one got stolen or misplaced. But I refused to try another one. It never failed me and during the entire two years I had it I used it almost everyday. I am completely satisfied with this one as well as trust it. Fits comfortably in my ear and doesn't fall out unless constant vigorous head jerking movement of course. But it really fits snug in your ear and is very difficult to fall out. I actually have never had it to fall out on its own. Had to knock or practically pull it out. Not heavy on my ears. Just a great earpiece by Plantronics. Nice job.

1.0,The GPS is unuseable and fails after a very short period of use,"Recently purchased a the Magellan RoadMate RV5365T-LMB. Unit seems okay. Since it only came with a quick start guide, which basically lets the owner know how to connect power and start unit up, but does nothing to inform one how to use the unit, I finding it tiresome to navigate around to find the features I want. I find I needing to spend lots of time in my vehicle trying to figure out how to use the device. The quick start guide shows a link to download a user manual but when I went to the link it list a different product. A search of the Magellan site failed to locate a user guide for the RV5365T-LMB unit.  Efforts to contact Magellan to obtain a user manual have gone for naught. They keep sending me the same quick start guide. It would be nice to have a manual to refer to when learning the new GPS. I feel the product support is weak. I am baffled Magellan does not have a user manual. I've had Garmin all my life and purchased the Magellan as I liked the advertised features, now I hope I'll be able to use the features. This may be my first and last Magellan purchase. Magellan finally sent me a useable link for a manual. I have had several occasions where the GPS gave me incorrect directions, once even telling me to make a turn onto a road that did not exist (and from the size of the trees one had never existed).<br /><br />After using the unit a few times I started receiving a error message and the unit would just recycle on and off. At this point it was about 40 days old. I contacted Magellan and they replaced the unit. I used the replacement GPS unit it a few times on short trips with no problems. Yesterday I took  longer trip. After about 1 to 2 hours I received an error message ""application error"" and the unit begin to recycle on and off every few minutes. It did this repeatedly, so I unplugged the unit. After a half hour or so, I plugged the unit in and it seemed to ""boot"" up normally, then went into a recalculation mode to check my selected route. The unit never left the recalculation mode, so after about 1/2 to 3/4 hour I unplugged the unit. As I neared my destination I plugged the unit back in and it booted up, calculated my route and appeared to be normal. After about 1/2 hour I got the ""application error"" message again and the unit once again began the recycle routine.  This is the second MagellanRV5365T-LMB I have had, and both have experienced the same behavior. The GPS is totally unusable for its intended purpose and totally unreliable. Based on my experience with these two units and their failures after a very short period of time I would not recommend this GPS.",[],B00BG2BCEE,B00BG2BCEE,AGRHNPPYVHHQ6AEXL3HNWNG3HYPA,1367323571000,12,False

4.0,Just arrived; works as well as I was hoping,"My Voyager 855 just arrived this afternoon. I plugged it in to charge, and it was fully charged when I checked on it again a few hours later.<br /><br />The headset connects to devices easily. You have to hold down the call button for it to connect to bluetooth, to turn on, or to turn off -- probably to prevent it resetting or turning on in one's pocket or when answering the phone by pressing the call button. My samsung found the headset instantly after it had been paired. Although, I had to manually connect it back to my phone after testing the headset on my laptop -- i still haven't figured out how to use it to listen to music from my laptop.<br /><br />So far my preference is to answer calls by sliding the boom out -- that was one of the features that drew me to the voyager, and I'm happy with its functionality. It slides easily with slight pressure from your fingertips, and you can prevent it pulling on your ear canal by holding the face side of the headset with your thumb while sliding the boom with your finger.<br /> The reviewer who noted that to answer calls with the call button, you shove the headset into your ear-hole was absolutely right about that. Answering by extending the boom absolutely solves the problem, although the placement of the call button is undeniably a design flaw.<br /><br />The volume/track-forward/track-back buttons are on the edge of the device, and easily distinguishable by touch. Predictably, pushing the volume button closest to the top of your head turns the volume up, and the lower button turns the volume down.<br /><br />Above the volume buttons is a mute button, which is also easily distinguishable by touch.<br /><br />My first phone call was to my mother, who is hard of hearing and tends to shout into phones. She didn't have any trouble understanding me, and I could moderate her volume easily with the on-board volume buttons. Others are shocked when I tell them that I'm on a headset. I've washed dishes while on the phone, and no one has complained of any background noise.<br /><br />I think the biggest surprise for me is that the sound quality is better than from my cell phone. I'm having some technical difficulties listening to music, because I apparently have abnormally small ear-holes. The gels that come with sound isolating ear buds never fit me comfortably, so I've taken to wearing my earbuds without gels. This seriously reduces the audibility of bass tones. The quality of voice calls is basically unaffected by the lack of gels though.",[],B000UBNFT2,B000UBNFT2,AEERMEWUK2VETJED65R7K7U2VJ7Q,1231991677000,3,True

4.0,Very nice set of earbuds!,"Let's start off by saying I am not a tech expert, just a novice, but I know what I like and what seems to work well for myself and my family. In our house, we go through headphones are charging cords like nothing-my youngest is always losing them or breaking something, so when I was offered a chance to get these at a discounted price for my honest review of the product, I of course took it! Let's start off with packaging-came in a nice box, extra ear bud pieces and manual. The color of the green is beautiful! The cord length of these is nice and long, pretty much standard. It has a volume slide control that was nice and easy to find, multi function button, and hands free mic. The sound quality is pretty good-not as clear as a more expensive brand, but for the cost of these-under $10-pretty darn good (that is where I go down in my review stars)! My only complaint, when you turn these up to almost full volume, you will get some cracking like noise-at least my pair did. Now, I do not mind it because I would NOT use them at that high of a volume-no one should-but I did this a couple times so I can let you know in my review. This is nothing new though because most will do that. As far as not picking up outside noise when on a call or listening to music, it is pretty good. Not everything is &#34;cancelled&#34; but alot is! Overall, this is a great pair of earbuds for the price-alot better than most you will find in the store or online!

5.0,They work as well as I hoped,"I've only had these one week but I love them!  My father-in-law has the titanium model and loves it for walking around the neighborhood and being able to hear traffic, etc.  I thought I would like the open ear design for walking/running outside and also because I have small children and I like to listen to music and podcasts but still hear them easily if they need something.  These work perfectly for these purposes.  It took me a day or so to find just the right placement that was comfortable. I have a bony lump on the back of one ear that was sore at first but I have found a good placement that works. I love being able to hear traffic easily, talk to people I'm walking past without having to pause the headphones, talk to my husband if I'm around the house listening.<br />Super easy to pair, battery lasts plenty long for my purposes.<br />One thing I have found you can't do with these is sit on the couch and lay back. The stiff part that goes behind your head gets pushed out of position. I didn't get them for this purpose so it's not a problem for me.<br />I have a friend who has hearing loss in one ear due to a viral infection, in her 30's, and she said she can hear on that side with these.

1.0,If you have a large notebook you should look elsewhere,"I have a HP Envy 17T-j100 that I got for Christmas.  There are several problems.  First lets talk about ventilation, the flat metal plate lays right against the bottom of the notebook, blocking all airflow, because the back legs of the notebook hang off the back of the tray where the notebook sits.  Then comes the problem of balance, when you have the display of the notebook open, it tries to fall backward off the tray because the tray isn't deep enough.  Then there needs to be some kind of bumper or something to keep the front of the notebook from being scratched up by the metal tray.  I tried to solve these problems with a couple strips of Velcro and some small clear bumpers that they use on cabinet doors and drawers.  Once I got those problems kind of resolved, another very ugly problem reared it's head.  The bottom leg isn't long enough to deal with the large notebook being cantilevered over the back of the tray, so the whole thing is very unstable and tries to fall over backwards with my new notebook attached.  The tray that holds the notebook also isn't wide enough to hold a 17&#34; notebook and you can kind of deal with that by having the leg down and cantilevering the left side of the notebook over the edge of the tray and leg, but that doesn't make it any more stable.  If they added some bumpers, maybe made the main tray a few inches wider and added another section to the bottom leg so that it could be folded out to stabilize the notebook, it would be ideal.  The mouse try never seem to be level enough to keep the mouse from sliding off, so maybe a custom fit mouse pad or some kind of edges on the tray, or even finer adjustments would be helpful there.  Even if the true dimensions were in the description, it would have been very helpful.  Other than those problems, I really like the idea and concept.  I'll probably keep it and make some kind of extensions that Velcro to the bottom legs to help with stability.",[],B00F8PMW0S,B00F8PMW0S,AHX65VZZUJU73CO4UN7OMEOJMX2A,1389110821000,3,True

I'm fond of it - the sound quality is pretty good, the colors are very crisp and clean and it's fairly easy to figure out how the whole thing works.  (This is my first Creative Product.)  I have some minor gripes with it, such as the ""random"" feature seems to have an insatiable need to play songs twice in a row, or play songs from the same album through most of the album but since I tend to have to laying next to me it's easy enough to skip the track.<br /><br />The layout of the buttons is a little annoying, and once you put the player inside the [[ASIN:B001EW665G Creative Labs Leather Case for Zen X-Fi (Black)]](optional) the buttons on the right side are a bit hard to access.  They're quite small, also, and I have dainty little fingers!<br /><br />I have no attempted to use the SD card, so I can't make comment on that.<br /><br />My only really big gripe is the software.  Good lord, it's awful.  It doesn't sync!  (Are you reading this, Creative?)  This means that if you add music to your computer you're going to have to manually add it to your player when you dock it.  I'm thinking of trying a different software altogether out.<br /><br />These things aside (and except for the software they're really not big issues to me) the player is solid.  It has good sound (I have Skullcandy headphones, I didn't use the earbuds that come with the player) and it looks sharp without looking cheap.  I'm fairly impressed with the Zen X-Fi.

My laptop battery was dead before I plugged in this charger,  so I was able to compare the charge time for the original branded one to this off-brand charger.  It showed an hour and 54 minutes which is pretty much exactly the same as before, so no complaints.  The pouch for when the charger is not in use is a bonus for me.

My particular issue is when using Apple Airplay to mirror my laptop to my Apple TV. As soon as I try and turn on Airplay, the Router craps out.

Airplay works great on my Netgear router.<br /><br />I love Airplay and used it all the time before upgrading to this Router, now I can't use it at all. So two stars for the bugs and for the ridiculous ""cloud based"" configuration they tried to push on us.<br /><br />I think a lot of these bugs are brought on by manufacturers trying to make complex products ""idiot proof"". By trying to make them so simple that any consumer can set them up, they load tons of crapware trying to run on a pretty low power box.

1.0,From Awesome to Awful: Planned Obsolescence?!,"I was initially pretty happy. Here's what I wrote:<br /><br />I don't want to repeat in detail what some 8000 other people have already said. So, I love the Kindle Fire for its great features and its size, it is a true handheld device that I can easily put in my jacket pocket and take to places like I would do with a pocket book. And, yes, a bigger touch-keyboard would be helpful (as others have mentioned), but I find using a stylus a good solution. The shiny screen problem is better after applying a screen protector. And, yes, the privacy issues make me feel uncomfortable, including the lack of password-protected shopping.<br /><br />But here's the really weird thing: Why on earth is the on/off button sticking out in a way that it will inadvertently get switched on (and suck the battery empty) as soon as you put it into a briefcase or backpack? That's a really dumb and unnecessary feature. This button has also caused a couple of surprising shut-downs just because I was changing the way I was holding the device and inadvertently pushed the button (and you can't just turn it upside down in some applications to avoid this problem!). What were the developers thinking? Ever heard of recessed power buttons?<br /><br />But here's my update after a year and a couple days of usage:<br />The warranty for my Kindle Fire expired on Nov. 16, 2012. A couple days later, the device stopped charging. When going through the troubleshooting provided by Amazon, I was able to do a hard reset, but it still would not charge. Another hard reset later, and it would not turn on again. I have not been able since to even turn it on. This looks suspiciously like planned obsolescence -- constructing a device with a built-in failure so that it will cease to work shortly after the warrant expires. I would not suspect that had I not read a great number of reviews on Amazon Askville and on other places where people reported similar problems. The issue has even attracted the attention of websites like ZDNET (see [...] although their recommendations end with ""call Amazon,"" too.<br /><br />In any case, I originally rated this device with three stars, but after this experience, it's down to one. Either Amazon produced and sold a device that was not ready for the market, or they did indeed cynically follow the principles of planned obsolescence.",[],B0051VVOB2,B0051VVOB2,AG23AW56WZ7KPYYAS4A3YUDTYWCQ,1325049015000,2,True

5.0,"Easy to set up, works very well","My Lensse MidX Pro came yesterday - took 10 minutes to set up and balance using my Lumix GH-2 and the standard kit lens (14-42mm or equivalent to a full frame 28-84mm lens). I quickly flew it through the house with great results - exactly as I had hoped for.<br /><br />I then used my C-mount Tamron 4-12mm lens. This is a tiny lens that can be used with the micro four thirds cameras like the GH-2 using the in-camera Extended Tele convert (ETC) mode which gives about a 21mm full frame equivalent lens.<br /><br />This one was tougher to balance because the lens is so small and the GH-2 is already light. The solution was to add a weight to the handle arm's top bracket (at back) and then use a small weight at the bottom and add several small metal washers (not included, grabbed them from my shop).<br /><br />What works for me in balancing is:<br />1) Add one of the included weights to the bottom and then move the camera on the mount forward or backwards to get a rough balance point so that the camera is not tipping downward (camera is too far forward) or up (camera is too far rearward). If you added a weight to the top (back) mount, you may have to adjust the horizontal rod, pushing it rearward by a little, and then also re-adjust the camera location. Only move the camera about 1 mm at a time. Tiny movements can make big changes to the balance point.<br /><br />2) Adjust the bottom bracket by twisting to one side or the other to get a rough left and right balance (so the camera is horizontal left to right).<br /><br />3) Hold the Lensse by the handle and move your hand back and forth, left to right. If the camera and bottom sway in and out, you have the wrong amount of weight on the bottom - and you are not balanced yet. Add or subtract weights on the bottom until you can move the unit left and right without sway.<br /><br />4) Keep a stash of small metal washers (mine are 1"" or so in size) as they help fine tune the weight and balance.<br /><br />Once you've figured out balance points and weights for a given lens, write down what you did, Having a log makes it easy to set up the Lensse with different lenses.<br /><br />I left my camera strap on my camera and sort of wound it around the camera. While very light, this gave another bit of weight shift to make very minor corrections.<br /><br />Dynamic stabilizers like this require that everything be balanced. If the system is swaying back and forth, you need to work on the balance some more!",[],B004L4RHFC,B004L4RHFC,AHB5EVZHUBBIATX4L65NVQL4VOOQ,1331092853000,6,False

Installation of the screen protector wasn't exactly as how iCarez wanted it but I got it on. Only by looking at the home button can I see that it is very slightly off. I even pulled the screen protector off during my installation. I squeezed out a couple of air bubbles. There was a small area where it was obvious that it wasn't completely sticking. I gave it a week and all traces of the air bubbles are gone. It looks good. Using this more at home I don't expect any marks to show up like my phone.

So brownie points to the company for that.<br />Another thing I liked about it, it came with the ribbon cables, so it was as easy as installing and reassembling my console to get it going, (don’t forget to replace the thermal paste if you do this).<br />Okay now on to what I dislike:<br />The actual product itself, when inserting a disc you kinda have to shove it in the drive to get it to pull the disc in, and it sounds really rough as it pulls the disc in (this could possibly be because mine could be faulty or damaged during transit, something the seller makes clear in their product description).<br />Final point, the ribbon cables were not pre folded and were a bit short, so I had to use the ribbon cables from my PS4’s old broken drive and use those.<br /><br />Other than my two negatives I had with this product I am really happy with it and really happy that my PS4 Pro is finally back to reading discs again.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />P.S.<br />Please keep in mind that it is for the CUH-70XX PS4 Pro only, I’ve noticed that too many people buy the wrong product model and end up $50-$80 out of their pocket because they got the wrong product. Please research what PS4 model you have.",[],B08X374Q62,B08X374Q62,AGBRAIRCCOPXBRTWGQ3FGDYB2FBQ,1635035297958,1,True

This is a known common issue<br />Haunted? One morning the whole system started making startling popping sounds at max volume at 3 am which woke and scared the whole family). This is a known common issue<br />Sometimes movie dialogue is hard to clearly understand unless I switch it to “Dialogue Mode”, but dialogue mode seems to completely turn off the satellite speakers and the sub.<br />Despite the wide soundstage the detail sometimes sounds diffuse.<br />1 HDMI input only<br />Settings accessible only through the app<br />Bose app is NOT in any way shape or form intuitive.<br />Amazon Music app incorporation: I’ve run into issues where the apps gets confused if I have the bose app and the Amazon music app open simultaneously. So if I play a any music through the bose app using integrated Amazon music, then move to the Amazon app itself and start a song later on, things get whacky<br />Lossless audio NOT supported - Major head scratcher<br /><br />Subwoofer Pros:<br />Absolutely perfect surreal stunningly clean bass at low volume up to max volume with no detectable distortion. I have personally never heard more perfect and accurate sounding bass from any speaker or subwoofer no matter the price point, even in theaters.<br />Beautiful Design<br /><br />Cons:<br />Upsetting Neighbors 3 blocks away (some may consider this a pro)<br /><br />Surround Speaker Pros:<br />Surround Effect. The audio quality is on par with the soundbar, maybe even better than the sb with certain noises and effects. The surround effect is so convincing and lifelike that I often inadvertently duck my head or glance behind me thinking something is about to hit me.<br />Individual volume adjustable in app<br />SMALL - sleek and totally out of the way unlike larger bulkier lower quality surrounds I’ve had in the past.<br /><br />Cons:<br />None. I’ve seen other reviews complain about low volume but that’s why you use the app to turn them up as loud as you want.<br /><br />Remote:<br />It’s as sleek and well built as the speakers but the button design is still confusing enough that I often resort to using my tv remote instead. One major advantage is that the bose remote adjusts the volume in smaller increments than the tv remote and is just flat out more concise than trying to adjust volume through the app by sliding my finger across the tiny volume slider which sometimes jumps too loud or to quiet inadvertently.<br /><br />Summary: this is a simple, high quality system that the average person and bass enthusiasts will LOVE. It’s not perfect however, tech challenged folks will find setup a frustrating process. If you don’t use a cellphone or tablet then you cannot setup or use this system. The glitches are incredibly frustrating to deal with so chances are you will experience one or more of them at some point. Atmos is not supported which may be a dealbreaker for some but does a fantastic job with 5.1 or 5.2 (for those needing 2 world class subwoofers).",[],B07JGHKFNW,B07JGHKFNW,AGIJHV55QP4CTMDHZH4JI72JFZ6Q,1614369065572,5,False

Also, if the internet goes offline I receive a message letting me know when is offline and when it goes back online. If the alarm gets triggered, I receive an phone call from the alarm system, a text message and an email. So, I always get the notification no matter what. I like how the main box has that green light showing its breathing and alive. You can set it up how you like it, it has many options.

5.0,Very happy with my purchase,"I have nothing but good things to say about this laptop. I haven't had any of the wireless problems others have reported, where the wireless connection is continually lost. Other thoughts:<br /><br />1) I added a 2TB HDD for $90. It was absolutely painless; as others have reported, it was as simple as removing the back panel (held in by a single phillips screw) and plugging the new HDD in. The HDD needs to be the 2.5&#34; type and 9.5mm thick. After replacing the cover, I can detect no movement or rattling from the HDD - it appears to fit quite snugly.<br /><br />2) The back panel also provides access to the battery (it is replaceable) and the memory, which has a slot for an extra stick.<br /><br />3) After a lot of research, I did not add a second stick of memory. From what I've read it is overkill for most users. From both of the benchmarks I found, going from 8GB single channel to 16GB dual-channel provides only a small increase in performance UNLESS you do rigorous video encoding. The choice is up to you of course - the option is there.<br /><br />4) I was able to get Ubuntu 15.10 up and running after a lot of troubleshooting. The way to get it to work (as described by another user review here) is to start Ubuntu with the &#34;nomodeset&#34; command line option. Then update to the proprietary Nvidia drivers (&#34;sudo apt-get update&#34;, then &#34;sudo apt-get install nvidia-352&#34;). Then make sure it is setup to use the proprietary Nvidia drivers (*NOT* the Nouveau drivers) by checking in Ubuntu's &#34;Additional Drivers&#34; utility. Do yourself a favor and use Ubuntu 15.10 for this, as it uses kernel 4.2, which avoids a problem where the wireless card on this computer not being recognized. Otherwise you have to update the kernel yourself, and I went through several hours of troubleshooting crashes/freezes before I ditched the latest LTS release for 15.10, which solved all my problems.<br /><br />5) I use this computer for work (on my Linux partition), and for fun/gaming (on the Windows partition). It plays even modern games quite well. Most of the time I play older games though (3-5 years old) and, as you'd expect, it plays those at max settings without even needing to turn on the fan.<br /><br />6) Speaking of the fans, this computer is very quiet. There is *zero* noticeable sound from the computer under most use. Only when I am running the most modern games do the fans get louder, or when I have it sitting on the bed and the ventilation is blocked. When the fans do turn on high, they are noticeable - but what else would you expect?<br /><br />7) The default setting of the touchpad is so sensitive that my palms passing near it while typing activates it. This is an easy fix however. In the bottom right, right-click the icon &#34;ELAN Pointing Device&#34; and select &#34;Property of Touch-Pad.&#34; On the new window that pops up, go to the &#34;ELAN&#34; tab, select the the Elan Smart-Pad device, and click Options. On the &#34;Additional&#34; tab in the new window, move the palm tracking sensitivity down to your preference (for me, this is one step above the minimum). Make sure that if you're doing all this with your touchpad, as opposed to an external mouse, that you don't turn it down so low that you can't use your touchpad anymore!",[],B015PYYDMQ,B071P26PBW,AH5ZZLLZAZHJMZPIJNLVMU2BOCIA,1447966805000,7,True

I read other reviews about it running hot and it did start to warm up after about 15 minutes.  I would say be mindful of air flow but where I have it in the house I don't think I'll have issues with it overheating.  It's doing what I need it to do, run my internet.

Keep the receipt!<br /><br />It was simple. My only problem was that I misread or the rep misheard the CMAC number, so it took 24 hours for them to reset the modem registration.

5.0,Works Great!!,"I just had this installed in my car yesterday at Circuit City for about $76--well worth the price of professional installation! (And much cheaper than BEST BUY!) They did a great job, wired the power and the antenna directly into the radio & behind the dashboard--no wires at all.  However, as some other reviewers have noted, be sure to get an FM Modular tie-in thingamajig, only costs $20 on Amazon (cheaper than in-store), and the reception is 1000% better, no interference whatsoever vs. a wireless FM hookup.  I believe the other reviewers are correct when they say the Stiletto has a much weaker FM broadcast than the previous Sirius models.<br /><br />One other small drawback: the dashboard mounting arm that is supplied w/this unit is a bit short.  Because of the way my car is configured (older Infiniti I30) the docking station is a bit low, not exactly where I want it. I think I'm going to invest in an aftermarket Sirius gooseneck mount, which sells on Amazon for $17-$25,[[ASIN:B00024L6S4 Arkon SR-88 15-inch Flexible Gooseneck Satellite Radio Mount for Delphi Skiff or Sirius Satellite Radios]] as it looks like a better solution.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a great product for your Sirius radio.

We both have skin allergies, I wear my FitBit 24/7 and I have no skin issues from these. Side note: They are a little stiffer than the FitBit brand and out of the package they do not quite curve around your wrist like the name brand does. But after about a week of wear, they do. I didn't notice a lack of curve, my daughter did, but after a week she said it was fine. I think the trade off is a week of adaptation for a band that is more durable. We have been wearing these bands for 9 months, they still look great, fit great, and no allergies. I just decided to change to a different color after all this time.

4.0,Docking a star for incorrect info on their website,"So I was almost ready to go and write a 1 star review of these boards but then after fiddling I was able to get them working. I am not new to Arduino (and CH340 clones) and have used scores of different boards over the years.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Boards look very well made. at least on the samples I received the solder is clean and all the components appear to be attached straight.<br /><br />MicroUSB!!<br /><br />I also have seen in some reviews that the 3.3v doesn't work on this board. The boards I received do have working 3.3v reference pins.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Totally wrong information on the sales page. The instruction clearly say to use the ""old bootloader"" option which has become very common since IDE 1.6.x. I tried to test each board just uploading a blink example to make sure they all function, but could not get the first board to work. I tried both bootloader options and then also went out to the link in the questions and downloaded the exact CH340 version from their GitHub. Nothin. After a bit of troubleshooting and getting the same issues with the second board, I updated AVR core  (""Arduino AVR Boards"") via the boards manager  to version  1.8.3, set it to ""old bootloader"" and tried again. Nothin. Set it to use the new bootloader  (Just labelled ATmega328p) and finally success!! Clearly the instructions on the site are wrong and these boards are in fact using the new bootloader. In addition, you may have to update your AVR core to get them to work which isn't mentioned anywhere.<br /><br />-1 star for wasting 30 mins for me to get to the point where I could upload. I will amend to 5 stars if I don't find any weird issues with the boards and the seller updates information on the product page.",[],B07GPPK4DK,B07GPPK4DK,AF6WOSXDHERPGKBGLPZQB43GPFKQ,1620402034533,0,True

5.0,Amazing multipurpose keyboard,"This isn't a keyboard for someone looking to get a cheap one just to work. This one is geared toward MMO gamers, but it is also very useful if you program, write code, or just need macros. I used this to play all genres of games, and it does a great job. I actually replaced my gaming PC with the K70 because this keyboard was so long that it didn't sit on my lap desk without hanging off the side. I took my K90 to work with me because I type a lot and needed the macros for the work I do.<br /><br />The technical stuff:<br /><br />It's a full sized keyboard with 18 macro keys on the side, but you can actually flip to M1, M2, or M3, which means you now have 3x as many macros (3x18=54 macro keys). I like the blue tint and silver finish, which is all personal preference. The big gripe people have about the keyboard, which is somewhat understandable is the top row of keys (esc, F1-F12, PrtScnSysRq, Scroll Lock, and Pause Break), and the 6 keys above the arrow keys (Insert, Home, Page Up, Delete, End, and Page Down) are domed, not cherry red switches. I never really had a problem with this, and I still love this keyboard, but if it's a huge deal for you to have 100% cherry red switches, get the K70 or K95. K70 if you don't need the macro keys, and the K95 if you want/need them. The wrist-rest is actually useful. Most wrist-rests that come with it, I just don't even put it on because I need something that will not hurt my wrist over time, but this wrist-rest is very well thought through when constructed to keep your wrist straight to help from getting carpal tunnel.<br /><br />5 stars for shipping on time, quality, comfort, looks, and price.",[],B005QUQP94,B005QUQP94,AFJSD3HROUVSOQZVFPQNIAF3WWPQ,1380229025000,0,True

4.0,"Powerful, huge, runs very hot and probably not ready for primetime","I will be the first to admit that I love chasing arbitrary performance benchmarks even without necessarily having a real world application to utilize their full potential. I've been running SMB to small enterprise grade networks in my two person home for the better part of a decade and have been on the Unifi platform for much of that. When the 2023 Macbook Pro M2s shipped with Wifi 6E, I was due for a laptop upgrade anyways and decided to upgrade my office access point to the U6 Enterprise so that I could take advantage of that sweet, sweet 6ghz spectrum.<br /><br />First, the good:<br />* This is the best wireless performance on the market today, pretty much bar none. I hit sustained 1.2Gbps up and down via iperf3 to a wired client with a 2.5gbe ethernet adapter over WiFi 6E with a negotiated link rate of 2400Mbps. That is literally better than gigabit ethernet and we have officially reached the point where wireless can replace a wired connection for many (though I still have wired backhaul throughout the house, it's used primarily for 2.5/5/10gbe applications).<br />* It's Unifi, so the adoption process is smooth and you manage it the same way you manage the rest of your fleet.<br /><br />Now, the reality check - some of these are true negatives, while others are just things to look out for:<br />* Unifi's 6ghz + WPA3 implementations are not ready for primetime. They just aren't. There is no support for mixed WPA2/WPA3, so unless every device in your house that connects to your existing SSID supports WPA3 (and works well) then you're creating a second SSID with WPA3 for the 6ghz network. Apple's network panel doesn't like this, and neither do I. It introduces complexity into roaming and in my case, where I have one Wifi 6 AP and one 6E AP on either side of the house, means I'm changing SSIDs depending on what room I'm in.<br />* It gets UNBELIEVABLY hot. The exterior housing is north of 100f during moderate usage, which means the internals are significantly hotter. Has not been an issue yet, but it does make you wonder if thermal throttling or a reduced lifespan is around the corner.<br />* It's huge! At 2.4lbs with the mount and 9"" of diameter, it's nearly as heavy as a Macbook Air. It has the same footprint as the equally gigantic U6-LR, but weighs a half pound more (which is a lot in a device this size).<br /><br />General Unifi gripe not specific to the U6 Enterprise is that the new management console interface heavily pushes you towards using their automatic channel optimization functionality, which works poorly and results in regular dropouts. Doing a manual RF scan and utilizing the least busy appropriate channels and leaving it be completely resolves the issue.",[],B09TX6W8H1,B09TX6W8H1,AECEETN7N252AYHD5HSIY7OULWBA,1678309750573,4,False

Paramount + crashes my phone so I'll have to buy a type c to HDMI adapter and see if it'll work for me.  The picture quality was surprisingly good and it is bright.  We were in semi-darkness and could see the picture really well.  Of course the darker the better but playing a movie at dusk should work fine.  The screen does not come with a stand so you'll have to adapt something to hang the screen up but it gives a pretty good picture quality on the silk.

1.0,"No Page Numbers Hard to Navigate, Download Problems","I love the convenience and reliability of Amazon and e-books, but the latest changes are cause for concern, and may mean I seek a more open architecture for e-book purchases.<br /><br />The main issue is a recent change of policy at Amazon that now when you order a product it is not automatically available on all your devices, it will only download to a single default device. So if you want to read across multiple devices e.g. iPad, Kindle and sometimes the computer, you have to log in to amazon and go through a super tedious process to download each book to the devices you want to read it on.  The screen you need to go to to download each item does not remember or indicate which books have been downloaded so if you order say 30 books and you want to read it on three devices then you need to access 60 drop down menus each of which have a delay meaning you cannot do a lot of books quickly. This basically reduces the value of you get from these books, the convenience of being able to read on which ever device is to hand has been lost.<br /><br />I wonder what then what the future of these Amazon e-books will be, will there be more changes, maybe books will be redacted and modified at will, or even removed.<br /><br />I am also completely amazed that the Kindle (& BTW Kindle for Mac) has no page numbers or feed back regarding what chapter you are reading.  It is impossible to get from one ""page"" to another or even one chapter to another easily.  It is like being lost in a sea of pages with no structure.<br /><br />The Amazon location numbers are very long and impossible to remember (e.g. 32% - Locations 10,949-1,007 of 35,045 [I am not kidding]), particularly in large books. It really needs some sort of overlay telling the reader the chapter number & name as well as the page numbers.  There should be someway to ""easily"" bring up the index and contents page without losing your spot, so you can jump to different parts of the eBook.  The Financial Times edition on the iPad has one of the best navigation techniques I have seen for a tablet. The Kindle designers should take a good look at the FT implementation to see what navigation looks like when it is done properly.<br /><br />The Kindle interface is so badly designed in this essential detail that I cannot believe anyone could enjoy using it for nonfiction, or that this issue does not get more airplay in these reviews.  Though I see now after searching the net that many people find the lack of page numbers and difficulty of navigation a problem.  This problem is particularly acute for reading technical books, so exactly where you would expect an eBook to have a strength it is weak.<br /><br />Until the page number and navigation problems are fixed I will not be buying any more Kindle books.<br />As I understand the other eReaders on the market do have page numbers, so maybe I'll try the Nook or Sony while waiting.<br />Other eReaders do apparently have page numbers.<br /><br />Another problem for using e-books as text books is that there is a limit in total to how much text you can highlight, once you hit that limit that is it you cannot highlight any more text in anywhere.  So again very limiting for non-fiction text books etc.<br /><br />Another problem is that the keys on the Kindle are very hard to press, and the paint identifying each key has warn off in some places so I have to guess/remember what the keys are for.<br /><br />I use the kindle a lot, but these changes make me think of looking at other e-readers and a more open platform.<br /><br />My advice is wait until they fix these problems, before getting a Kindle. (Perhaps also don't put all your eggs in the Amazon basket)",[],B002GYWHSQ,B002GYWHSQ,AHI7UK2GUCQYJWLU3PXEOXE4ZGQQ,1297732957000,4,True

I love music, and my slowly progressing hearing loss has been robbing me of the pleasure of hearing music as I had heard it for so many years.  These ear phones are just incredible.

This should be a given these days for any streaming device.<br />Pro: Voice control to turn TV on and off and control volume. Some controls within some specific apps such as Netflix, such as pause and continue.<br />Pro: Listing your shopping list shows the list on the TV screen.<br />Con: Bluetooth is poor. The range is much shorter than a Echo Dot. In addition some bluetooth units simply won't work with the FireCube TV.<br />Pro: depending on your TV it might control it via the HDMI cable versus line of sight needed for some other devices.<br />Con: It is bulky compared to many  other streaming voice units<br />Con: The wired network connection is a kludge with an adaptor. It works, but another item to hang off an already bulky unit.<br />Con: Slower response than some newer devices when using voice commands It takes a couple seconds to respond to things like pause, continue, etc. You get used to it, but it you keep wondering did it hear the command.<br />Con: Some apps need to be uninstalled and reinstalled to get working again. This happens on some other devices. Have not see this happen a lot, but it has happened.<br />Con: you might have to repower the unit if it really gets confused. Not often, but has happened. This seems common with such devices.<br />Con: Voice commands for some apps are not there. Also it is very basic in it's understanding of commands. 'Alexa pause movie' confuses it.

5.0,Great but New Price is Shocking,"This Hard Drive worked just as advertised. I've had the drive for a year almost. It was surprisingly quiet, comparing it to the defacto Seagate 320GB Hard Drive I had inside my HP Elitebook before I swapped it eventually with the Vertex 3 Max IOPs Edition SSD. The Drive can get louder over time as more space is occupied; I noticed a sound hike when the drive was beyond 80% of its capacity. Overall, I would recommend it.<br /><br />However, the new price for it is kind of shocking; I bought it at Amazon for $149.99. Now I see it over $219, almost close to the price of the 3TB Hard Drive.. Because of that, I would wait till that inflation goes down; otherwise at its original price of $150 dollars, I see it as a solid buy....",[],B004CSIG1G,B00DI12GSM,AEMSZIK4NJFF3JDLAJLXYYYG5VGA,1326755109000,3,True

4.0,Unit works.......CS however is a big 1 at best!,"Okay, let me start with the beginning.  I bought my 3G system from the actual maker, Trackimo.  I am posting a review here because Amazon sells these or other sellers through them and people should see reviews of the system where as Trackimo is not set up on their site to allow reviews.  I got a $30 off coupon from ordering from them and thought why not.  I purchased this system to place on my sUAS systems in case of a fly away to track them down for recovery.  After much research with this unit and the Marco Polo and fact the Trackimo utilizes GPS rather than just RF I went with it.  First off from the actual maker it took almost two weeks to get to me which was a bit puzzling but none the less arrived just fine but in a padded envelope (one can see the danger here)!  So I open the padded envelope then the box the system came in and the instructions are, well, very brief to say the least but the gist was initial charge of the battery is 12 hours plus in the unit itself which has a usb connection you plug into it.  Now the system only comes with a usb cable and no actual charger but good news is, most any cell phone one will work.  So the instructions say when you first plug it in a blinking red light will occur then solid when the unit is charged.  Okay, simple enough.  Well upon plugging in no light what so ever.  So no biggie, I keep it plugged in a few more hours thinking it will start due to it being extremely low charge.  NO DICE.  So I contact Trackimo through the chat session and am told it is very low and that is not unusual and let it charge overnight +.  Okay is my response &#60; still being very nice!  Well 24 hours on the charge and no light!!!!  So I contact them again and the chat person links me a request for a new battery thinking that is it.  I think, okay, decent CS here.  I fill out the request and a day later the responder with Trackimo says try charging again for another 24 hours.  REALLY!  REALLY!  Ok, I will just to show you I know it is a battery I suspect.  Now mind you I even told them it may possibly be a battery issue but without a actual known working battery I cannot tell, it could be the unit!  So again to the charger, NO DICE!  So back to the chat or actual email this time to respond and tell them......hey, not working I need a competent battery to determine it is actually a battery issue.  Well, I figured this would be a goat roping with them so I come to Amazon and get a extra battery and the charging cradle and viola................it works!  So once the cradle goes from red to green indicating charged battery I install it and it works!  So the issue is the unit has a issue with the charging port!  Guess what.............not heard back from Trackimo still!  In fact both batteries work!  You would think Trackimo would contact a buyer who just spent almost $200 on something that fits in the palm of your hand to see how things are or to say, your replacement battery is on the way.  So to the unit............tracked flawlessly and within 20-30 feet of actual location as seen on the map.  Unit works &#60; well minus the fact the on-board units charging capability!

4.0,Great option - no batteries to replace!,"I was looking for a wireless option and did not want to constantly cycle through batteries (they always seem to die at the worst possible time) and wanted to avoid setting up a charger for rechargeable batteries. I came across this and was intrigued. After reading some initial reviews, I decided to give it a go and am glad that I did.<br /><br />I prefer to work in a slightly darker corner of our office (easier on the eyes) and this keyboard has no problems charging there.  The layout is good and I like the programmable function keys option. It took a little adjustment going from a standard mechanical keyboard to this one due to the shallow keys that provide a different response, but no major issues there. There is just enough incline when you extend the back legs on it for me, but I would have preferred a little more (hence the 4 star rating.) The response is very similar to a laptop, so the keys are much quieter than my other standard keyboard.<br /><br />The solar app that comes with it is neat and informative and there is a key next to the power switch that tells you quickly if it has enough light to charge. The Logitech unifying receiver is also another great part of this kit.  I also purchased a new Logitech mouse and quickly got rid of extra cables and extra adapters.  One little ""nub"" in a single USB port and they work great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Solar power from just about any light source.<br />- Very quiet key response<br />- Solid construction<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Would have liked a little more elevation from the tabs in the back",[],B004MF11MU,B004MF11MU,AGLY5FUK2545RU4PMYDARSL4JWVA,1328885597000,0,True

5.0,Good Buy for Man Cave,"Upon moving into a new house that included a ""man cave"" i began searching for a quality sound system to accompany my 55"" Samsung LED without breaking the wallet.  AFter a significant amount of research & reading reviews, I found the TSS-800 on amazon, ordered it & purchased a new pioneed receiver as well.<br /><br />In short, this sound system is great for a room the size of a traditional man cave.  The speakers accompanied by a new pioneer receiver produce awesome sound for the price.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but in the end i was very pleased.  I chose to have the ""geek squad"" install the new receiver & the speaker system so that it was set up correctly.  THe powered sub is great, surround speakers great, the only item that need some tweaking was the center channel.  The surround kind of drowned it out, but the geek squad adjusted the receiver to balance the sound properly.<br /><br />overall, i'm very impressed with this product for the price.  However, this product might not be the best for a movie room (large movie room) but is definately above the rest for a man cave type room.  Try watching termindator salvation on blue ray & make sure all your sound connections are HDMI.

5.0,Volks Talkie,"I am delighted with these radios!<br /><br />I've used hand-held radios at work for a long time: big ones, small ones and yet smaller ones, and I am at least peripherally aware of their common functions and accessories. These radios embody every function or accessory I am aware of.<br /><br />The most common situation is for users to only see the charging stands and the radios. Sometimes external mikes are used and sometimes advanced functions are programmed by the radio service company. These radios come with the parts and capabilities for all of this: you get two snap-in batteries per radio, a charging stand, an external mike, and even the programming cable (with instructions to visit the company website to download software), putting you in complete charge of your own operation. This is incredible, but even more incredible is the price: $80 for the set of two (at the time of writing).<br /><br />Maybe all this sophistication is intimidating? Maybe you just want to pull two radios out of the box and start talking without learning how to use all this stuff?  No problem. The radios come preset to a common channel and it's pretty self-evident how to change to another channel by using the up and down arrow buttons. Pick a channel, charge up and pop in a pair of batteries, screw in the antennas and push the push-to-talk button: you're up and running. If you want to communicate with Jake behind the utility building, you're functional as soon as you charge a pair of batteries, but when, and if, you want to explore the advanced features it's there waiting for you. You even get a feature not commonly seen in commercial setups: the radios can be plugged into charging cables like cell phones, without using the charging stands.<br /><br />They say there is no free lunch, and I'm looking around for them to pull back the pastrami sandwich but I don't see it coming yet. Compared to internet enabled trickle-down technology like home camera systems, the security risks here are less subtle and hence less insidious: anybody can monitor what you say (although there are ways to make it harder to eavesdrop), so don't transmit anything which it would be disastrous for others to overhear. Once you begin sending info via the internet the risks are both less transparent and higher--it's the difference between being overhead because you are yelling to the backyard and having your mail intercepted.<br /><br />I presume commercial systems costing conservatively a factor of ten more are better in some way, probably related to reliability, and if you need that kind of reassurance you will go to a commercial vendor and pay their price. But if you need handheld radios for any of hundreds of non-critical cases where cell phones are inconvenient or unavailable these inexpensive yet fully capable radios are a godsend. I recommend these radios highly. The best value is the two-pack, and if you need three you might consider buying four--I may buy another set as spares just to lock in the price.

Come back and its done. Another great feature is scanning small photos.  Put photos on the glass (leave a little space between them) press the scan button and when they are scanned, the software recognizes and saves photos as individual files.  I didnt know software could do that. The printer is a bit noisy starting up but when its actually printing, its no worse then any other printers I have owned.  It looks like it could be an ink hog, haven't printed much with it yet the black cartridge is showing 1/2, but that may be a software issue.

Should work on Windows and Mac with little issues. Major plus is the padded keyboard. Cons is the short foot stands to raise the back of keyboard. Could use larger feet or dual length feet I have seen on other keyboards. If you need it raised then use common items such as two folded wash cloths or a long padded keyboard rest (nothing fancy) to raise it up and give it a soft feel.

2.0,Decent keyboard with one fatal flaw - SAVED BY SHARPKEYS!,"Edit: After being completely disgusted about the right shift key location, I searched for key-remapping options.  SharpKeys is a quick-and-easy solution for Windoze 2000/XP/7/8.  Make sure you download it from the author's website as the first two installers I downloaded (from sites I had considered trustworthy) were full of bloatware.  Once installed, I swapped the mapping of the up-arrow and right shift keys on my K400 and wow what a difference.  I'm actually pretty happy with this keyboard after this fix.  I would increase the rating to 4 stars, but the credit goes to randyrants_dot_com for the software, not Logitech.  The only downside with this fix is that it swaps the keys in the OS, so if you plug in another keyboard the up-arrow and right shift will be swapped on that too.  And if you VNC or Remote Desktop you will likely experience the same problem there.<br /><br />The only unfortunate thing with this finding is that there are so many reviews of this keyboard it's not likely that many existing owners will see this fix.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />The K400 is a decent wireless keyboard.  The layout is pretty good given the small format.  The tactile feedback is good.  The battery life, so far, has been pretty good.  I've only had the keyboard for 2 months but just discovered the on/off switch, so I'm fairly impressed the battery has lasted this long (although it may also have an auto-off power save feature).  The range is just okay.  The spec indicates > 30', but my couch is just 10' from my PC in my media center and if I'm reclined or have my legs up a bit it tends to block the transmission.  If I have the media cabinet door closed the range is only a few feet at best.<br /><br />Despite these few short comings, this would be a nearly 5-star product save the one fatal flaw -- the location of the right shift key.  If you look at the right shift key on any well-used keyboard you'll generally see a shiny spot on the left side - where most people strike the key.  Logitech, a company which typically puts out some good, smart products, blew this one.  They put the up-arrow key in this location, making a skinny little shift key to the left of the up-arrow.  After two months of use I still up-arrow virtually every time I try to use the left shift key.  It drives me nuts and and is the reason for the 2-star review.  I have no earthly idea what they were thinking, I can only assume they never actually tested it.",[],B005DKZTMG,B0BXYXD1Q2,AGS2KXRMVHEJOTD4L4OA6YQ4NHKA,1363752816000,2,True

4.0,Use with RetiCam for maximum reliability.,"Review for &#34;Smaller Phones&#34; version: I ordered this &#34;sold by Amazon&#34;, and it is indeed a genuine Joby GripTight GorillaPod flexible tripod. The flexible tripod legs hold any position very strongly, and I have absolute confidence in this tripod's build quality.<br /><br />However, the plastic spring-loaded phone mount does not give me confidence when it holds my iPhone 6. Not only is the spring not very strong, but due to the thin profile of the iPhone 6, the iPhone 6 slides forwards and backwards depending on how you hold it. So if you were to shake the tripod or hold it in certain angles, over time the iPhone 6 will probably slip out. I use my iPhone 6 without a case. This mount may be fine for you only if you use a bulky rubber case.<br /><br />So, after owning this for 1 day, I quickly purchased the &#34;RetiCam&#34; phone mount which is made out of CNC aluminum. That gives me utmost confidence, and when I use that combined with this Joby Flexible Tripod, its a perfect solution. See my attached pic of me hanging the phone upside down without a sweat!<br /><br />Lastly, be careful when bending the legs. When I first opened the box, I pinched my fingers 3 times...woops!","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OvDn-p-TL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OvDn-p-TL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OvDn-p-TL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B009GHYMB6,B009GHYMB6,AGPMCG2UUYGN2DLQWILVLLYI2RWQ,1465158776000,7,True
4.0,Works well and compact.,"10 Port Surge Protector, IECOPOWER Electrical Multi-Plug Outlet Extender, Wall Mount Extender Power Strip with 4 USB Charging Port, Night Light Black.-<br /><br />I like this surge protector but it’s a little odd to me.  The clear shelf that can be placed on top is the part I don’t really like or use. It’s not that it doesn’t work it’s more that I don’t trust using the holder and it feels like I’m putting too much weight on it.  It does seem to hold up fine but it also is a tad of an eyesore with that plastic shelf.  I think it just works better for me without that aspect.<br /><br />Outside of the shelf part, this thing works great.  I haven’t had any issues with it.  I don’t know how well it will hold up to surge because I don’t believe I’ve had any yet.  I do like the number of plugs that this provides.  The USB ports make life so much easier now that most devices only come with the cable and not the power block.  I’m sure this will only continue so it’s becoming more necessary to get products like this where you can just plug USBs in without the power block.<br /><br />The output seems good.  Though I haven’t used it where I’ve filled every single port at once.  I do like the size of this product.  Especially if you don’t use the shelf part this is great for traveling because you can throw it right in your bag.<br /><br />All in all, I like this and I would get another.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Hwex6eNFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Hwex6eNFL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Hwex6eNFL._SL256_.jpg'}

2.0,Added Cost Over T Series Is Not Worth It,"Comply foams are good in three cases:<br /><br />1) the stock eartips on your IEMs strike you as uncomfortable;<br />2) you need better isolation than whatever ear tips you are using;<br />3) you have driver flex issues in your dynamic driver IEM.<br /><br />Numbers 1 & 2 are pretty straightforward. What is driver flex? Read on.<br /><br />Driver flex is the dark secret of most dynamic driver IEMS. When you shove the driver deep in your ear canal (or even not so deep) the air pressure can sometimes make the tiny thin little driver inside the housing move a little bit. You can hear this happening; when you push the driver in, if you hear a cellophane like wrinkling noise, that is driver flex.<br /><br />What happens after the driver flexes? Sometimes nothing, all is well. (However, the long term health of the driver may be at risk. There is no real evidence one way or the other, but anecdotally, many online users claim their earphones had shorter lifespans due to driver flex.) Other times, you will have volume level drop in one or both ears, sometimes even no volume at all in the affected drivers. Other times, you will have bass drop out in one or both ears. These two problems - volume level disparity and no bass - are vastly common complaints in earphone land. How many of these complaints are actual defects and how many are due to relatively easily fixable driver flex? Who knows? Note though that balanced armature IEMs seem to be immune to this issue as they work differently in terms of mechanics and seem relatively insensitive to pressure flex.<br /><br />Not all dynamic drivers have the flex issue. It depends to some extent on driver shape, then on eartip shape and material, then on internal ear canal shapes for each user. My dynamic drivers from Monster and Shure were never affected by this issue at all. Other models I own from Thinksound, RHA, Velodyne, and MEElectronics have the problem to a greater or lesser degree. My BA models - from UE, Etymotics, & Brainwavz - have never had this issue at all.<br /><br />Comply foams fix the flex issue by expanding slowly after you compress and insert them. This gradual expansion does not create the sudden pressure changes that can mess up dynamic IEMs. Plus the Comply foam is soft and isolates well.<br /><br />What's the downside?<br /><br />1) Attenuated treble, warmer sound. Many people like this combo. If you like classical or acoustic jazz, it makes a lot of music far less enjoyable. All earphones I tried various Comply models on had this issue - T100, T200, T400s on Monsters, Velodynes, Brainwavz, UE, & Thinksound. More bass emphasis, less highs. I absolutely disagree with Comply's statement that there is no audible effect on music with use of their foams. There may not be much effect, depending on your music. Jay Z may sound fine, but Mahler's Fifth or Sketches of Spain will sound much the worse with Comply foams.<br />2) Hard to keep clean. Like Shure ""olives"" the Complies tend to soak up ear wax that silicone tips would never attract. This interacts with problem 3 below, as the foams then need frequent cleaning. Plus if you take them out with ear schumz and can't clean them right away, the wax dries and looks foul.<br />3) Durability. Complys do not take well to the rigorous life of portable IEMs. If you baby them, clean them properly and store your phones in a case, you'll get about 2 months of use before they start to lose pieces and compress less easily. If you shove em in your pocket or knapsack, maybe a month of use, barring acute traumatic episodes.<br />4) Cost! Do the math 1 - 2 months per pair, 3 pairs per package, $ X for cost and shipping. It's like having a mini cable bill. The stock silicones that came with your IEMs will last six months minimum and are dirt cheap to replace if and when you need them.<br /><br />The Comply TX series costs more than the T series and adds an ear wax filter screen. These don't sound worse than the T series (i.e. still adds warmth, attenuates highs) but they do add cost for a sort of gimmick. Many canalphones already have a filter or grill across the sound tube, and my relatively waxy ears never produced any accumulation of wax on the internal filters on the TX400. Unless you have a regular candle factory in your ear, the 15% price increase is not justified.<br /><br />The Comply series is an imperfect solution to some very common IEM problems. Unfortunately, there are not many other universal fit solutions available for multi-brands. Shure and Etymotic tips are much more durable, cost less, and don't mess up the sound as much. The Sony Hybrids are also a fine tip choice. Unfortunately, all these other brands do not necessarily fit brands other than their manufacturers. A secure fit is vital, otherwise the tip gets wedged in your ear and you are off to a loved one with tweezers in hand, or off to the ER if you have no loved ones available. Unless you are positive your Shure Olive or Hybrid will fit your specific Brand X, Comply is the only game in town if you don't like your original fitting options with a given earphone.<br /><br />Comply has a new TS series tip out with an oval shape (a la Klipsch Image S4s) which is said to attenuate the highs less. Haven't heard them myself, they don't seem to be available on Amazon, and, of course, they cost more than the base models. Considering the unhappy cost to usefulness ratio of the TX series, I would say caveat emptor...",[],B002OOWBWA,B002OOWBWA,AHKGIXB5KR72QOZ7CCIWXARLX7GQ,1347476747000,4,False

2.0,"Chromebook, get a Windows instead!!!","I would recommend this more for a student, not much of a work station, or a notebook, more like a college campus tool. At first I was impressed, I thought I could have used this to continue to learn coding Python, Java, C, etc... But after a while the limitations became very apparent, yes Linux is available, but limited, most of the things you can download are some what functional, but it's definitely not a notebook compression. Before any one shuts this review for the fact that the purpose of this was for internet browsing capabilities, just keep this in mind, remember tablets, yeah, also why would Acer out in hardware comparable to their windows version of the spin 13 in the spin 15 charging a hundred dollar more, wtf? As I can see, Chromebook's are just another tablet in a market saturated with gadgets we don't even need when the phone market has eliminated the need for a internet only tablet aka Chromebook's. Get a real notebook don't make the mistake I did, I am now trying to save up for a real notebook. Google stop making more useless gadgets, all we ask is for a simple laptop that can be used for learning, working, coding at a reasonable price, mind you there are Linux laptops with the same hardware as this spin 13 yet they charge a thousand, why? Google has proven that the prices some of these notebook charge today may not be solely on the hardware but based on licensing, heck there's even a MacBook with the same specs as the spin 13 for thousands. Wished there was a reasonable laptop for people who don't wish to break the bank, and wish to use em for work purposes, if it could be a Linux too, that would be a plus, nothing against window's but window is far too restrictive on letting you mess with it, Chromebook is even worse then Windows not allowing you to do much unless approved by the higher up. FYI don't buy the Acer Spin 13, get the windows version instead, for a hundred dollar more, you can actually use it as a laptop, and with the same hardware too which shows you what a scan Chromebook and windows really are.",[],B07GD4CMDH,B0BKTBD37R,AHIZZ4MTPTUUDJ3EOYCJDTAS653A,1579630408396,3,True

5.0,Great value for the money,"It is a beautiful laptop. Sleek and light weight. [See update at the end Jan042013]<br /><br />I have an HP g7 1326dx that I just got a few months ago. This unit fares very favorably and despite some of the things noted below, I'd choose this one over that one. The Acer is noticably snappier, the display is better looking and the USB 3.0 port seals the deal. Integrated bluetooth 4.0-HS is a great added value that the 1326dx doesn't have, 4.0 or otherwise. That dang dongle is just about a deal breaker though. For what it is worth, the Windows score for the HP is 4.5 and the Acer is 4.3. HP's graphics drag it way down and the processor drags the Acer down.<br /><br />The touch pad has no left/right buttons so that is something to get used to. The bottom part of the pad tilts down for clicks. I've found right clicking to be a challenge. Put your finger pad on the edge of the hard plastic and use your finger tip for right clicks.<br /><br />Left clicks that need to be held, like Chrome's back button being held to see history, requires use of the bottom left click as opposed to a tap and hold anywhere.<br /><br />The keyboard is part of the ventilation system so it cannot be covered with a protector if you like to use those.<br /><br />The display is really crisp.<br /><br />Although it doesn't come with a restore disk, you can make one. It offers to do that when you boot up the first time. Mine said I'd need 5 DVDs (~15 gig) but I reckon you could cut it down with higher capacity disks. If you don't have any pick some up so you can burn your restore image right off the bat.<br /><br />Battery life is okay. I played some mp3s for about 2 hours before the battery gave out. Far short of the 4 hour mark but running the built in speakers non-stop isn't what you'd do anyway on battery power alone. I was just curious to see how long the battery would last. The 1326dx has much better battery life but it has 6 cells and weighs a little over a pound more.<br /><br />There is one USB 3.0 port and two 2.0 ports. It is hard to believe that the price difference in the two types of ports is the reason for not having all three be version 3.0. It is backwards compatable with 2.0. The performance difference is huge. I'm guessing it was mostly a marketing decision so folks don't have to know 3.0 is backwards compatable or even what backward compatible means. A nice 3.0 thumb drive would be cool to get with this laptop: [[ASIN:B006B7R8ZG Corsair Flash Survivor USB 3.0 32GB Drive (CMFSV3-32GB)]]<br /><br />[Edit 07/14/2012<br />I ran a some casual tests on the USB ports. Wow! The 3.0 thumb drive is super fast even on the 2.0 ports. I found that copying to the drive on the 3.0 was almost as fast on the 2.0 as the 3.0 port. For testing I used a folder that had a couple of dozen files with a size of about 450MB. The 3.0 was as quick as 28 seconds and the 2.0 was around 35 seconds.<br /><br />I tested the same folder on my HP's 2.0 port and it took 101 seconds to transfer the folder to the drive.<br /><br />So a good USB 3.0 drive would be a great purchase to go with your new laptop if you don't have one yet.<br />/edit]<br /><br />All 3 USB ports are on the left side. Something to be aware of for sure. My other laptop has one port on the right side and two on the left which I find to be very convenient. All other ports for the Acer are also on the left side. The right side has only the DVD drive. A USB hub may be handy: [[ASIN:B004WM36WG J-Tech Digital SuperSpeed USB 3.0 4-Port Hub Backward Compatible with USB 2.0 with USB 3.0 Cable]]<br /><br />There is no Lan plug. Nor is there a monitor port. Instead Acer has created a proprietary port that uses a dongle cable for external monitor and RJ-45 cable. I'm on the fence about that as a feature. It means that you have to keep up with the dongle or you won't be able to use a Lan cable or D-plug type monitor. So if you forget or lose the dongle and the location you are at does not have wifi you're up the creek for Internet access. WiFi is built in so that may not be an issue for you at all.<br /><br />There is a built in HDMI port so you could use that if you didn't have the dongle with you. As long as someone had a handy HDMI cable and a monitor that supported it. Bah.<br /><br />Amazon has this in the tech details: ""500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive Solid-State Drive"". Acer lists the drive like that too. According to Hitachi it is a SATA drive. [edit: Nor is it a Hybrid HD. Just a plain old normal HD.]<br /><br />I really like this laptop. The snappiness seems to be better than the HP, which is a quad-core, and the screen looks better. It is a lot of bang for the buck.<br /><br />[Update Jan 4th 2013<br /><br />If you will need to do a lot of typing with this laptop's built-in keyboard you may want to rethink your purchase. I noticed that I made more mistakes on this laptop but I assumed it was just my poor typing skills.

5.0,So comfortable,"These airpod pros are the most comfortable earphones I’ve ever used. I barely feel them in my ears - they just feel light and airy. The music sounds so clear and crisp and warm. I had been using Sony wireless WI-1000X prior to switching to these AirPods. I love Sony for the deep bass but those particular headphones really didn’t work well for conversation and also when it’s hot out, the battery part you wear around your neck just gets clammy and uncomfortable, so I was ready for less physically intrusive headphones. Initially I was wary of the AirPod design (how the heck do they stay in your ears?!) but now that I’m wearing them for the first time I’m sold on this design. Also they paired so quickly and easily with my iPhone straight out of the box. I’ve been using noise cancelling headphones for over 20 years and personally I wouldn’t bother with any headphones that didn’t have that feature. It really makes a huge difference in clarity and what you can actually hear in loud environments. Even something as simple as a dentist visit - when they’re drilling or cleaning - you can actually hear your music or podcast. And if you’re on public transport or a train or plane you can actually hear whatever you’re listening to well without having to crank up volume. Spatial audio is really nice too when it’s available.

5.0,First keyboard was faulty; resolved by good customer service,"Final update, 10/2019: Arteck contacted me and sent a free replacement for the keyboard that had quit working. Apparently the first one I purchased had some kind of fault that made the M and N keys fail. The second one works like a dream so far, and the customer service I received was excellent. Bottom line, this keyboard is comfortable, portable, and easy to get up and running. Combined with the good customer service, I'd definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Original review: I'm a transcriptionist, so I type really fast and spend a ton of time typing. When I decided to get an external keyboard, I knew that it needed to be comfortable, portable, reliable, and easy to set up and use with a Linux operating system. In most ways, this keyboard fits the bill. It's easy to move around to wherever I need it. The chiclet-style keys feel really nice to use and are not too loud, which is good for when I'm working late while others are sleeping. Getting connected was seamless; I plugged in the adapter and the keyboard was instantly ready to use.<br /><br />My only complaint is about the M key. Probably about a tenth of the time, it just doesn't respond when pressed normally, and I have to stop and hit it again harder, which throws off my rhythm and slows my typing speed. I haven't had this problem with any of the other keys, only that one. Everything else about the keyboard is nice enough that I'm still using it, however, and will likely continue to unless the issue gets worse.<br /><br />First update to original review: After a few weeks of use, the N key has largely quit working.

This doesn't happen with any of my other TVs (Sony and Samsung 32"" LCDs) even while they are both streaming HD content, so it's a Panasonic problem and needs to be fixed.

2.0,Finicky at best,"Buyer beware, these cameras are as finicky as can be. Some days they were great, other days they just disappointed to no end. I've had two cameras now for two months, one of them before Christmas the other one in early January. At the moment one of them is working, the other one cannot pair. I've reached out to support, and all they do is parrot the pairing process, which I've done now countless times, without success. There is no doubt a hardware issue with this particular camera which they don't want to rectify. The other issue I find with this product is the app. The cameras are advertised to be used either with a SD card, or with purchasing a monthly iCloud account. Since I don’t live in a high traffic environment, I decided to go only with individual SD cards per camera. The issue I find with the app using the SD cards is that for one, it keeps prompting you to purchase the iCloud plan, over and over again, then when trying to view an event, the app tells you “there is no SD card for this event”, so you’re forced to close the app, reboot it, then hopefully you can it. This faux pax happens time and time again which makes using it truly cumbersome to the point that you don’t want to view anything anymore.<br /><br />I’m at the point now that I ready to take a loss on these two cameras and move on to another product which I see rave reviews about on Amazon.

The installation was simple enough that I didn't have to look at the instructions. Even doing so was pretty straightforward, with the only issue was omitting the size of the drill bit you should use for drilling holes for the plastic anchors included. Not a big deal, but could be frustrating to drill a hole that's too big and have to shift the mount over to conceal your mistake. Other than that, the mount is pretty solid and sturdy for the Google Nest hub or other devices.

5.0,A great biography of a great man - riveting and essential reading,"When I was a boy growing up in South Australia, I distinctly remember the day the news broke that President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. I remember it because after I heard the news I began to cry.<br /><br />I was 11 years old and to this day I don't know why I cried. I knew nothing of American politics and I had only seen scant television clips of the President on one of the 3 stations on the TV, that broadcast from 4.30PM till station close at 11PM. I knew he was a great man however and admired by Australians and my school teachers.<br /><br />When Steve Jobs announced that he was resigning from Apple in August 2011, I knew the end was near for the great man and I felt a lump in my throat. The day after his death, I was walking in Pebble Beach and I met a neighbor. We stopped chatted for a few minutes and Steve Jobs death came up in conversation and we both started crying. Steve Jobs was a great man, whether you liked him or not.<br /><br />I never met Jobs, but I knew about Apple, having owned a Mac a couple of years after they were introduced. Stories of his unusual behavior were already legend in Silicon Valley when I moved here with Sun MicroSystems in 1991. Sun Microsystems kept close tabs on what Jobs was doing with NeXT as the Sun UNIX workstation began it's meteoric rise.<br /><br />I listened to the Walter Isaacson Steve Jobs biography over a couple of weeks on my commutes to the WittyParrot office in Bay Area, (I am an investor in and advisor to WittyParrot, a new Silicon Valley Software company) and was riveted by the story and the storytelling skill of Isaacson.<br /><br />When I arrived at the office I would share the latest insights I had gleaned from listening to the Jobs story with the design team at WittyParrot and I sent several emails with condensed insights and suggestions on the design and out-of-box experience.<br /><br />For entrepreneurs, designers and engineers, the Steve Jobs biography is a case study in the importance of thinking outside-the-box, simplicity and elegance in design, and execution.<br /><br />From the numerous true anecdotes throughout the book, it is clear that Jobs was a tyrannical leader, ripping subordinates to shreds and firing people summarily. He did however build a team of ""A"" players who were extremely loyal and believed in the Jobs Apple mission... which was to change the world.<br /><br />His reality distortion field influenced and inspired others to do what was previously thought impossible. He would look subordinates in the eye with an unblinking stare and exclaim ""this is shit"" on being show work or programing that was less than breathtaking, to see if they believed it was less then their best.<br /><br />Steve Jobs changed our lives in the same way Thomas Edison did a hundred years earlier. He was an inventor like Edison, with more than three hundred patents in his name and like Edison, he was a visionary. Jobs obsession with creating technology products that incorporated art in their design gave us products that redefined the look and feel of consumer electronics and computer retailing.<br /><br />Every reader of reader of this article has been touched by the experience of using Apple products. It's worth recalling some of the breakthrough products that Jobs and Apple gave us, here are a few that changed the World:-<br />Apple-2 one of the first mass produced personal computers.<br />Apple Lisa and Macintosh, Mac - the computer for the rest of us, which heralded a new era of computing and introduced the GUI, the mouse and beautiful fonts<br />iPod, - a thousand songs in your pocket<br />iTunes - a new spin on music<br />iPhone - The Internet in your pocket<br />iPad - The iPad is...""<br />Apple Stores- the most profitable stores on the planet<br />The App Store - More than a thousand apps. One simple new way to get them<br />Pixar Animation - Toy Story and many others.<br />Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography is a riveting account of a life fully lived and of a great man who changed the World and is a ""must read"" for anyone in the technology business.",[],B005YUDWD8,B005YUDWD8,AEKCYHR2AD6VUBBXIWEWHVQ5FAMA,1381332728000,2,False

This is a defect related to the Roku system/box. How do I know you ask? When she told me it stopped working and could not &#34;detect area wifi networks&#34;, she called Roku support and got nowhere. Then she gave it to me so that I could see if maybe the problem was possibly she did. I registerd/installed the same device on my HDtv. It loaded up and worked for 4 hours and then it gave me the same message.

5.0,Great head unit for 2003 Lexus ES300 !!!,"This unit is great.<br /><br />I bought the AVH-X5600BHS ($349) for my 2003 Lexus ES300. After riding in my son and wife’s newer 2012 cars with head units that had Bluetooth, HD Radio, hands free, etc., I decided it was time for an upgrade.  I locked in on a touch screen DVD/CD player and selected this one based on the reviews here.<br /><br />The matching dash bezel (Metra 99-8158G) and wiring harness (Metra TYTO-01 JBL Amplifier Interface Harness) were about $25 and $50 respectively. I added a parking brake bypass (Genuine DIYBypass for All AVH Pioneer) for $15 so the DVD player will play while I’m driving and a rear view camera (Esky EC170-06 HD Color CCD Waterproof Camera) for $13.<br /><br />The entire install took me about 2 hours and half of that time was for the rear view camera and running the USB, AUX and Video Out cables to the center console.  The process is well documented on YouTube.com.  It’s amazing how the dash simply snaps together and the installation looks factory clean.<br /><br />Everyone who listens to it can’t believe I still have the original JBL amplifier and factory speakers installed. It sounds 100 times better than the original Lexus head unit and it has the latest and greatest features.<br /><br />I can see a replacement Sub-woofer in my future because this unit packs a punch via the 5 channel stock JBL amplifier.",[],B00H5A8OBK,B00H5A8OBK,AHRMZXASVAG45J4W26O6U6ROJRPQ,1418247140000,1,True

The built-in light is enough to read in a very dimly lit room but I would not recommend using it in the dark. The touch screen is a little annoying to work with, you have to press a bit hard on the screen for it to actually work. But the battery life, oh my God the battery life. I charged this baby the day I got it and haven't charged it since! I use it for about 20 minutes (1-2 chapters) every night and it just now needs to be charged!

I've tested it in various angles (including holding the iPad vertical) and it stays where I put it. I am very impressed with this stand. The material is light, but study enough that I'm not worried about my device falling. I appreciate how compact it is when it's folded up. The arms that hold the iPad are rounded so it will accommodate devices with different size cases (if you have one at all). When the iPad is vertical and I tap on the upper portion of it the stand does rock back a little but, but i'm never worried about it falling over. There are pads on the bottom of the stand that prevent it from sliding or damaging the surface it's on.

I found this one after much research and decided to purchase based on the specs for this one and my experience with the table top. I was not disappointed. This radio is a bit larger than a standard transistor radio but you can really see and hear the difference! This radio has a nice heft to it and the rubberized coating around the edge is a nice touch. The display is large and easy to read. The sound coming from the speaker is fantastic and the reception, AM and FM, is the best of any transistor radio I have owned since moving out to a fringe area of Los Angeles County. Most importantly, at least for me, is the fact that you can change out the batteries without losing your presets (as long as you do it within 30 minutes), a common and annoying problem with modern transistor radios. Yes, you will burn through 4 AA batteries in a week to 10 days if you listen as much as I do, but this little gem is worth the price!

1.0,"Bought 1, ordered another, had to return both","As an electrical engineer I offer the following.  Although the product initially worked as presented, I had to rate everything as 1 star because the product failed.  I did not experience the installation or display problems others have described until failure.  My uninstall proceeded without incident as well.  However, the design and quality control seem to be substandard.  And for the record, Amazon's return process has become so painless it was really no problem to return both units.  Thank you, Amazon.<br /><br />Both units failed, one by one, within days.  I had the same experience as others who commented that the product runs very hot.  For electronics, that's very bad.  I suspect one of my units failed due to heat stress.  The other unit had parts rattling around inside, which suggests poor quality control in the design and assembly.  If you get it, and it works for you, terrific.  But Amazon asked me to answer an unanswered question (which I could not find), so instead I elected to provide my review, which I seldom do, but this product offering calls for a 'buyer beware'.<br /><br />In the case of this product, while I feel sympathy for the designers and marketers because it is clear they tried hard to do their best to provide a great product at a great price, unfortunately the product just misses the design and quality control that is reasonable to expect.<br /><br />I don't know if it's acceptable or not to make a recommendation here, but I really needed a product to perform this conversion, so I turned to StarTech, also available on Amazon.  It's a different caliber of company and product, more expensive, but I have been using it for about a month.  It's well designed, runs relatively cool and without problems, and they have great customer support via chat - very knowledgeable people with immediate results.  I had a special need for this conversion and they helped me promptly understand the different techniques for USB-HDMI conversion so I could select the proper design.  They also readily recommended returning one of their products even though it had not failed because THEY discovered it was not the right one for my application. Pretty cool!<br /><br />If you change manufacturers for this conversion, remember you have to uninstall the drivers of this product first, then install the drivers for the product you choose to go with.  In the case of StarTech, their products works very reliably.  I have no affiliation with either of these manufacturers, I'm just writing what my experience has been.",[],B087PD9KSZ,B09YLWS9SP,AGHYNMMYNO2XTLR6CAVUY3U2P7KA,1614591746797,7,True

4.0,Little Small for my Canon 100 - 400 and 24 - 70mm L Telephoto Lenses Well Built Case!,"This is a well built lens case.  Like most Case Logic products, the zippers padded carry strap, padded handle and side panels are well designed and comfortable to use and carry.  I also like the flat bottom that allows the case to stand on its own to allow easy access to the lens.  It also includes a rain jacket, just in case you end up in the rain.  There is plenty of padding to protect the contents.<br /><br />I have a Canon 100 - 400mm L, and a Canon 24 - 70mm lenses that I hoped to use with this case.  The case is a little small for these two lenses.  They both fit, however, trying to remove the 100 - 400mm is not a one hand operation.  The issue for me is the lens hood catches on the inside lining.<br /><br />Maybe the best feature is the top zip case lid that seconds as a holder to hold the removed lens while installing the second lens.  This works while removing the smaller lens to install the telephoto, but not the other way around.  Unless you prop the case between your legs or something else, it will fall over while placing the larger lens in the lid.<br /><br />I'm sure this would work great if you have a smaller set of lenses compared to mine, but for me the case proved to be a little too small.  That said, it is still a well built case and that will serve you well if your lenses fit.",[],B00IDYRZ94,B00MF97LXI,AGGNEZJKG35QXGBIZADSSC2QNPGA,1412858690000,8,False

5.0,Best headphones ever.,"So after numerous positive reviews I purchased and got my Skullcandy Crusher Evo just about a month ago and have been using it daily since. Have not regretted it and the reviews were on point.<br />As many have said the best way to describe and compare this to is imagine yourself with a very good home/car audio surround system inclusive of bass sub where you are able to appreciate not only mids and heights but also dynamic bass. Or in a dance hall standing in front of speakers. The sound and especially bass is truly amazing.<br /><br />I've never experienced anything like this from another headphones and really enjoy using it. It's a cut above the rest IMO. The haptic bass is out of this world and whatever the developers used to make it is truly commendable. What's noteworthy is that you lose nothing from the mids and heights either as those come through quite clear. It's simply perfect.<br /><br />About the bass, what I like is you can adjust it on the fly accordingly with the slider knob which comes in handy as you know different types of music have different levels of bass input/output so that is a plus to be able to adjust on the fly to taste. Although you can adjust to full/100% level if you're brave enough I generally would have it at 50% or somewhere between 25-50% (again depending on type of music) at a reasonable volume level because you don't want to go too high either for too long as you risk damaging your ears over time.<br /><br />I can't praise this headphones enough. It's a joy to listen with and one of the best investments I've ever made. Kudos to the developers for making it available.",[],B08FCGH2RL,B08FCGH2RL,AEXUVYDZKOYRJS7QDC4TTA5DNKSA,1633015191036,0,True

1.0,Huge Quality Issues,"Update 04/24/15: The second receiver also needs to be power cycled after every little power glitch.

Since this is the second unit that has behaved this way, it's not just one bad unit. Design is just not tolerant of any power line issues. It has become useless.<br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><br />Review specifically for Yamaha R-S201.<br />Sound quality is pretty good. Bought for use as a Zone 3 (Patio) Amp.<br /><br />First unit delivered stopped turning on (from remote or unit switch) unless ac power was removed and re-plugged, then it would work again for a while. Exchanged- excellent Amazon return service. Second unit has been powering up fine so far (4 days).<br /><br />Second issue: The speaker wire connectors are very cheap and small. Had a very difficult time connecting 14Ga speaker wire (long run to patio). You'll have to remove some wire strands negating the some of the 14Ga benefits. One spring loaded connector fell apart, switched to the B outputs rather than return another unit, but miffed that I can't trust the A connection on a brand new amp.<br /><br />For IR geeks, cannot not find any IR protocol info for this amp and it does not respond to the typical Yamaha Discrete ON or Discrete OFF commands, could learn the Discrete Inputs but OEM remote only has a Power toggle.",[],B00F0H88SY,B00FPLMSK4,AEVNGWF2NNLN4A5WLFM6BNF5FOEA,1402576519000,5,True

The Data Package Loss Rate is also huge with this router.  Playing simple non-data intensive games is a lagfest, and even simple net surfing has unexplained delays and lags reminiscent of dialup.  This is funny because I have the fastest residential internet cable connection available and should have the fastest wireless router, but when my network stops working, which happens often, I am forced to connect to my neighbors one bar, barely connected, un-encripted G-wireless network to send an email for work.

5.0,Solid Connection with Minor Tweak -- Great Connector for the Price,"There are a lot of people complaining about the loose fit and the connectors not ""clicking"" or staying in.  When these connectors are crimped, the locking tab gets flattened and stays down.  All you need to do is gently bend the tab back up and it will stay up again and allow the locking mechanism to work correctly again.  I have used over 30 of these connectors so far and have not had any issues with loose connections or connectors pulling out of the switches/jacks.<br /><br />Sure, you should not have to bend the tabs back up on a quality connector... but we are talking about only 4 cents per piece.  You can't expect them to be perfect at that price.<br /><br />I give these 5-stars because they crimp well and work great with a very minor tweak required after crimping.  If they were a full-priced connector, I would give them 4-stars, but they aren't. Wake up and smell the cable cream and stop buying inexpensive connectors and then give them bad ratings for a minor issue that can easily be fixed.<br /><br />. . . and for those of you that say you have many years experience terminating category cable - you can't honestly tell me that you have never had to bend up a tab to make a cable lock into place.  I have had to bend tabs on even the higher quality patch cables before.",[],B000I20AJ6,B000I20AJ6,AED7ZJJG3HIPXAVCN7ARYLFMA7CA,1323723793000,63,True

5.0,"Very nice, but not vibration free","I bought this tripod in preparation for a trip I was making through some of the National Parks. I live in the Southwest desert area so the summers are hot and dry and I wanted a light tripod to carry while hiking. The Manfrotto tripods, one of which I originally planned to buy, turned out to be a little too heavy. The full size aluminum ones start at 5+ lbs and the carbon fiber ones are only about a pound lighter. Since I wanted something strong enough to hold my equipment (a Canon T1i, a Canon 18-200mm lens and a Tamron 200-400mm lens) and something I would not worry about falling apart, I ended up choosing this Gitzo. The carbon fiber tripods were way out of my budget, but the Basalt were almost as light and considerably less expensive. I was pleasantly surprised by some of the features.<br /><br />1) I was used to the latch locks and did not expect to like the twist locks, but found to my surprise that they are more convenient and comfortable to use than the latches. As the advertisement says, I can unlock both on each leg at the same time, so setup is quick and easy. The twist locks seem to hold well and I have grown quite fond of them in the short time I have had this tripod,<br /><br />2) The tripod came with a tool kit (actually a bunch of hex keys) to keep the screws tight. I was not expecting that,<br /><br />3) The top plate where the head mounts has a screw for tightening against the head to make sure the head stays stable and a second screw to tighten against the extension column to keep the plate stable. But the plate tightens well and I don't believe either screw will be needed,<br /><br />4) The tripod is light. It is not as light as some of the competing Chinese tripods (one of the full-size Giottos is less than 1 Kg, this is 1.35 Kg), but it is light enough that I almost don't notice it when I carry it on my back,<br /><br />5) The hook that Gitzo provides for adding weight to stabilize the tripod is positioned at the end of the extension column exactly in the middle of the tripod. This is, in my opinion. much better than the off-center hook on the Monfrotto tripod. The hook is spring loaded so it retracts when not in use, and<br /><br />6) The tripod actually looks quite nice. I did not expect to care about how it looks, but the colors and simplicity of the tripod makes it look very nice.<br /><br />This is a full-size tripod and, when the legs are fully extended and the head and camera attached, I have to actually stand on my toes to look through the view finder. As nice as this tripod is, there appears to be at least one issue. When I extended the tripod legs fully, mounted the head and camera and took a time exposure of about 2 seconds, the image was not as sharp as I would have expected. When viewed at the actual pixel level, there appeared to be some blurring due, I assume, to camera movement during the time exposure. It was not much, but it was there. I then retracted the lower part of the leg to put the camera at eye level and tried again. No change. I then reduced it even more and compensated with the center column and the picture was spot-on. All of these were taken with the camera lens IS turned off, mirror-lockup enabled on my camera and using a 2 second self-timer. I was, as you can imagine, disappointed. I don't want to stress this too much. It only happened with time exposures on the order of 2+ seconds and not with normal slow photos. And it also did not happen if the legs were not fully extended.<br /><br />Clearly the tripod is light enough that camera vibrations from multi-second time exposures were enough to cause picture blurring. But before giving up on this tripod I tried hanging about a pound of weight on the central column hook and that seemed to take care of the problem. With that weight the time exposures were crisp and clear without any blurring and were as sharp as the slow photos I took at the same height. Since the problem only seems to occur for long time exposures I don't think this will be much of a problem, but I will start carrying a rock bag when I hike with it just in case.<br /><br />All in all I am very happy with the tripod. It was almost affordable for me, it is light enough for me to carry, it holds my camera and lenses well enough and the problems that I see are surely due to the lightness of the tripod itself and are easily addressed. I am quite happy with the Gitzo and recommend it with those reservations.",[],B0039YP16C,B0039YP16C,AGJH7OAA6Y226AXTC5X55EQBOB7A,1273338235000,6,True

Fortunately, you can download them via the cablematters website (http://www.cablematters.com/cs-Downloads.aspx).<br /><br />A word of warning though, for Windows 8+ machines, Windows will try to automatically install realtech drivers to get this device working, and that will screw it all up - in order to avoid this you must copy the downloaded driver file from the cablematters website, (www.cablematters.com/cs-Downloads.aspx) and paste it over your realtech driver file in the Windows/System32/drivers section of your device.

Further verification when I received a new EVGA PSU also rated at 600 watts and the resetting problem has been eliminated. Reading though the comments, I'm not the only one that has had this problem.

2.0,"wanted to like, but some simple things are left out. overpromised, underdelivered.","I've gone all in with Amazon and Alexa--the Echo Plus, Echo, Echo dots in every room, and I expected that the Fire TV Cube would be part of that system, but it's not. I have the Fire TV cube hooked up to an alexa enabled Yamaha receiver and all it can do is turn it on and off, but not much more. As many people have commented, the Cube does NOT work with multiroom music (nor does the alexa-enabled Yamaha receiver), which is absurd. I can play music on the Cube or receiver, but you can't add it to the group. The multiroom music function is might sound like we're all nitpicking, but I would give up 100 other features for this key one. Instead, I have to buy another echo dot to add it to multiroom feature, which adds yet another input and another layer of complexity. So instead of making things simpler, it makes things more complicated. If they solve this multiroom issue, then they can be a real competitor to Sonos. I'm told that Amazon is working on it, but I don't have my hopes up.<br /><br />I'm also disappointed with the basic software. It is intuitive for a techie, but I'm the only one in the house that can really get it to work with voice commands. I would have also expected a more advanced remote compared than the fire tv stick. if this is going to be the flagship TV product, it should have a volume button. Wouldn't that make sense? If this was their first product, I would be more understanding, but it's not.<br /><br />In the end, I feel Amazon overpromised and underdelivered on this product, so therefor I'm dissatisfied. If they had managed expectations, then I would be satisfied, but they sold it as the best thing ever with all these amazing capabilities. In retrospect, I probably should have gotten a fire stick and an echo dot, saved some money, and had more capabilities. But as I write this I realize that the problem is probably that the Fire TV team is different than the Echo team so it's unlikely that they'll all of a sudden start working well together.",[],B01NBTFNVA,B01NBTFNVA,AGZS7ZYHNUV5KDEFLLXGGTFALYRQ,1535339339932,0,True

The kick stand doesn't stand alone (you have to tuck it under the case or prop it against something).

Sometimes, I can push the 'connect' button and it connects right away (sometimes, I don't even have to push it as it automatically connects). Other times, I have to manually go through my tablet's settings. The keys are very cramped together and are not set up like a standard QWERTY; so, I often have to stop typing, scan the keys, and type in a whole different way. It's really inconvenient. I realize that it's for a smaller tablet so that likely accounts for the change of keyboard.

4.0,Well made No Trespassing sign,"We live in a rural area on many acres and while that is peaceful there has been many break-ins and property being stolen in our area recently. Mainly from peoples garages and sheds, barns etc. so we put up some cameras around our property but wanted to also warn people that we were watching them. I had looked in town at a few big box stores for some type of warning/no trespassing sign but they were either too small or made of plastic which I wasn't interested in purchasing. When I had the opportunity to purchase this sign at a reduced price so I could try it out and then give my honest opinion I was very interested. First off, it's a well made, heavy metal sign of a nice size. Comes with 4 pre-drilled holes in the corners to attach to a building or fence etc. As we wanted to attach it to a tree my husband screwed it first to a black piece of wood then he attached that to a tree.<br />It looks very nice, clear writing and very noticeable when approaching our house/barn. I am pretty happy with it and already had a comment from the delivery guy joking that now he couldn't steal our dogs because we were watching him ;)<br />All in all it was a great purchase, great quality and am very happy about being able to give my honest opinion.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WhMH9mdyL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WhMH9mdyL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WhMH9mdyL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B017AJ0ISC,B08WG19RPN,AEYFG26B2BCSFUHUWOYMGZS3PYFQ,1447700848000,1,False

2.0,Our last Roku was the Roku 3 and it was WONDERFUL to use,"I honestly cannot figure out how this TV has such a high average rating. We have owned Roku devices for several years. Our last Roku was the Roku 3 and it was WONDERFUL to use. When our last TV bit the dust, we decided to go with a Roku TV like this one so that we would no longer need to find two remotes. This..was...a...mistake. The interface on this TCL TV is PAINFULLY slow if you are used to the snappiness that a Roku 3 has. We have 100 Mb internet (Tested) and the TV has a full strength WiFi signal. Yet, here is how the evening goes when we sit down to watch something:<br /><br />1. Turn on the TV. Wait approximately 20 seconds for it to launch the dashboard.<br />2. Wait an additional 5-10 seconds for it to finally connect to the network<br />3. Scroll over to the Netflix icon. This can take 10 seconds or more because the TV is still booting up and the interface is very laggy.<br />4. Wait approximately 20 seconds for the Netflix splash screen to disappear and for the profile selection menu to appear.<br />5. Select profile to use. Wait approximately 20 seconds for the browse interface to load.<br />6. Wait 10 seconds for the thumbnails of our shows/movies to actually show up.<br />7. Click on a show. Wait 5-10 seconds for the show menu to pop up (I think this is slow because the device starts playing an episode at the same time that it is trying to load the menu)<br />8. Finally, select your episode. The buffering normally takes around 7 seconds for some reason (Roku 3 would start playing almost immediately on this same internet connection).<br /><br />This TV may be magical for someone who has never experienced anything better, but for us it is just an incredibly frustrating experience. I would absolutely NOT recommend this product for anyone and I regret my purchase every day. I can't wait for it to die so that we can justify something better. It's a $300+ hunk of crap.",[],B018TCCWEM,B00X3TUHWG,AEZYSTMEXLXDGHNRZJUECOJEV7DA,1469837093000,3,True

I was using the old CS1784 just as a USB switch but swapping inputs on the monitor was a minor nuisance I wanted to avoid.<br /><br />I started out with an Amazon Warehouse instance of this CS1924M and had nothing but trouble. I contacted Aten support and they were surprised it wasn't working. Eventually I returned the Amazon Warehouse version and got a new one, also from Amazon.<br /><br />The replacement came and it worked a little better but was still very flaky.<br /><br />I found it impossible to reliably connect a Macbook Pro connected through a TS3 Plus to one of the inputs. The video would constantly flake out. I tried upgrading the firmware, I tried changing modes in the KVM options, I tried different cables... Nothing I did could get them to work reliably. The system worked fine if I removed the KVM from the equation.<br /><br />The Aten support team was dismissive of the issue saying they can't guarantee compatibility.<br /><br />In the end, I couldn't use the V part of the KVM and was using the multiple inputs on the monitor in its place.

That said, I still think it's fairly simple if you just follow the directions.<br /><br />You plug it in with the RJ45 cable (cat5) and power it on, you install the camera ip tool and it finds the camera on the network for you, you then put that ip address into your browser of choice and then login.  From there it's just customizing it how you want.  I set it up with wireless and it sits roughly 60 feet away from my router.  The picture is near real time (30 fps) very surprised on the quality and speed of the video.  One thing to watch out for is you may not pick up the camera with your wireless router if you have a wireless G or N router.  It seems to operate on wireless B (has a further distance but not as fast as G) I just went into the wireless settings on my router and told it to use mixed mode or B&G mode.<br /><br />I have it setup with motion detection and to email me with pictures, which works very well.

4.0,Great watch.,Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. There have been a few dud apps that she's installed for it that seem to just crash the watch and force a reboot but after figuring out what to avoid she's got it working great now. She had a Garmin 620 that had spotty-at-best wireless reception even when 5 feet from the router but this watch connects flawlessly with Garmin Connect and immediately uploads workouts to her favorite sites. The only complaint is a discrepancy in treadmill distances. The watch is reading less mileage than her treadmill by about 1/4 mile per mile ran. It's not a dealbreaker as I wouldn't expect this to be too accurate anyway for a non-GPS workout.,[],B00RE1UKLC,B00RE1UKLC,AGSAMJZ5ATJS3YAUYPCNMRJIQJMA,1483444908000,1,True

5.0,"Terrific sounding Bluetooth speaker, Highly Reasonable Price","[[VIDEOID:cfa8eaaa4b660dc8a53cecd59b6a3707]] I am reviewing the Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with Emergency Charge Power and Bass Vibrating Membrane by Reacher.I received this speaker free in exchange for an unbiased opinion. I give it five stars plus for the following reasons. My opinions are not influenced by price. All comments are my own, valid and I stand by them.<br /><br />I have reviewed a number of bluetooth speakers and headphones recently and always start by saying I am not an audio expert or a technical perfectionist in any way, I just know what sounds good to me. This speaker is very reasonably priced for the sound it delivers and the additional functions, namely it is also a backup power bank. Everything about this speaker is high quality, rugged durability and construction. The speaker is available in three colors, but I am reviewing the blue speaker. I have other bluetooth speakers of similar size and quality that cost double but this one sounds every bit as good as the higher priced models.<br /><br />The bass tones are rich and vibrant and the speaker vibrates when you touch it while playing the right music. Higher tones are crisp and pure. Whether you are listening to  top 40 hits, rock and roll, disco, or easy listening, this speaker delivers terrific sound. And  you can listen for up to 8 hours on one charge! The speaker pairs easily with any device with bluetooth capability, just press the M button to go into pairing mode. I tested it on two android phones, one apple phone and an amazon kindle fire tablet. Pairing was a breeze. And once paired, the device will automatically connect when you turn your bluetooth and the speaker on. One additional nice feature I discovered when I left the speaker on but unpaired was the voice that told me the speaker battery was low and needed to be recharged. However it sat on standby for three days.<br /><br />The design is rugged and good for men or women, perhaps depending on the color, but I like the blue. The shape is a square pillar. You may set the speaker on its side, using two non-skid rubber feet on the bottom to stabilize it,  or you can stand it on its end like a column. The controls for power, answering calls, volume and next and last song are on a hard plastic band along the top edge of the column (when turned on its side). On the back, again as the speaker sits on its side, is a small rectangular inset of black plastic to give access to the charging port and, oh yes, the USB port where you can actually charge your phone, because the speaker is a power bank as well. There is an on off switch, a line in switch and a TF (or microSD) card slot.<br /><br />The overall appearance of the speaker is a fine metallic mesh with curved edges and a hard black plastic border on either end. This speaker looks just as nice as the sound it delivers. The unit stands about 7 inches tall by about just under 3 inches square.<br /><br />This Reacher Bluetooth Speaker/Charger is, in my humble, non professional opinion, one seriously good speaker that will give many, many hours of listening enjoyment. Backup phone charging ability is a nice cherry on top of this great little speaker.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzrqtouIL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzrqtouIL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzrqtouIL._SL256_.jpg'}

4.0,D300s or D90 or D700,"I bought a D300s a few months ago. I like it. I like the way it handles, and I have been getting some great pictures. It was a choice between D90 and this model, but what swayed me to springing for the more expensive camera was its full compatibility with older Nikon lenses. I have several older lenses, even one AI conversion, and it does work superbly with them. You can record all your old lenses (AI or AIS) in its memory, and it will work fully with these lenses - except of course autofocus.  The older autofocus lenses will work 100%.  If you don't have old Nikon lenses, you would have to decide for yourself if the extra features of the D300s are worth the money. I think Ken Rockwell is right about sugesting that you should move up to the D700, but the additional $1000 was tough for me to justify. (The D700 has a full frame sensor.) Since this is my first digital SLR, I had to get used to the images not being perfectly sharp when you magnify the image a lot. You see square pixels, not a smooth line. In retrospect, I might have gone the extra grand for the D700 to improve on this characteristic. But, I'm still happy with the D300s.  If you dont have Nikon lenses already, I would consider the D90 or the D700 first.",[],B002JCSV6M,B005MX9P06,AFQSR7X5GEDXXWYJ6L6FOOXH4B2A,1284746703000,1,True

This YUVETH wireless adapter addresses these problems that came with the wired Android Auto technology.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this adapter is in regards with the firmware update. It's too complicated and it fails a lot to go through even if you follow the instructions to a tee. I had to try different Android devices and it finally worked out. But it took me a good 1 hour off my day just to get it through. The manual does a terrible job explaining in detail how to proceed and most non tech savvy people will simply give-up altogether.<br /><br />I didn't notice any improvement or glitches before or after the firmware update. So who knows what it did.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this adapter for anyone looking for the full wireless Android Auto experience. It's liberating and seamless.

I liked the more powerful flash as well. Nice feature and setting options.<br /><br />Cons: If you use flash a bunch you'll only get about 80 photos before you get battery warnings and have to replace the 2 AAs.

2.0,Finest Corinthian Leather? and Cardboard!,"[My original review is below]<br />My current opinion is less flattering to this case. Here's why: I owned the first one 5 1/2 months before the very stiff clip tore from its backing, rendering the case useless for clipping on a belt. Still, I liked the case so much I ordered another. I believe that the quality of this second case is not quite up to the standards of the first, because even though I was very, very careful to avoid tearing the clip from the backing while using this second case . . . it DID tear, and it tore within two weeks of my receiving it. So this is a word to the wise, that if you use it to clip to a belt or whatever, be careful that it doesn't tear off the backing.<br /><br />Based on my experience with this case, I do not recommend it. It is not built to last. The clip is very stiff, the backing very weak.<br /><br />[Original post]<br />I don't really know what kind of leather it is, but this cover is tough and it looks great. I've had my iPod touch a little over a week and always keep it in this case. I've already dropped the iPod on a ceramic floor while it was in this case and the case protected it perfectly. If you're no more careful than I was, then this case is for you. My only qualm is that the thickness of the leather next to the screen means you have to be careful when touching near the edge of the screen. Compared with my opinion of this case in all other respects, this is nothing.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Pu4SOlHhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Pu4SOlHhL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Pu4SOlHhL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B000WOIFO2,B000WOIFO2,AGBYX7343P6TLJP4JW2MFD3AT5XQ,1270428902000,0,True

Good job Amazon!  Properly protective and recylcable packaging.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of for checking out these drives for errors.  I personally use Spinrite 6 for checking drive surfaces.  Once you put these drives in an array, Spinrite 6 will not check them.  I believe you can unplug the SATA cable for each drive and check it individually, but I have not verified this.

1.0,Never buying an LG again,"I needed to upgrade to an ultrawide monitor that had a higher (at the time refresh rate). For an ultrawide, this wasn't terrible. The HDR was pretty much useless but the picture quality was decent and the 144hz was a very noticeable improvement even over 100hz. But, the monitor went out just before the warranty expired (which is only 1 year in the US) with crazy lines and artifacts everywhere, what you would expect when the board of a monitor goes completely out.<br /><br />The timing of the failure was questionable as a week later and I would have been screwed, but at least it happened within the warranty. Had a chat with LG, they said to send the monitor in and they would take care of costs for shipping and handling and the box itself. It took another week and multiples contacts and an ""escalation"" to even get a return label  emailed to me which they first said they would be mailed to me(Why they didn't just email it to me in the first place, I'm not sure)- I took the monitor up to Fedex and come to find out they did NOT take care of shipping and handling or the box, which all ran me $75.<br /><br />I waited two weeks after sending the monitor out and had to send several inquiries asking about if they even received my monitor yet. They HAD received it (an update would have been nice) and had no ETA on when the monitor would be repaired. A month later with no response and I reached out again and they said they were currently waiting on a part that would arrive in two weeks (again, an update would have been nice). Two weeks pass with no other updates and I get a text stating the monitor was unrepairable and that I could be refunded.<br /><br />It's not the fact that I had an issue that bugs me. It's the monitor only have a 1 year warranty (if the monitor had broken just 10 days later I would have been screwed) and the horrible customer service. I've been through a lot of issues with other vendors, ASUS, Samsung, Sony but other than the occasional QOC issue they are all easily resolvable. I've definitely learned my lesson with LG. There is a reason they have a C- on BBB (the lowest of any monitor manufacturer I could find by a large margin) and I won't make the mistake again.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813FsXgCkzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813FsXgCkzL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813FsXgCkzL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0798Q8KG4,B07SG7645F,AHE2ZRR5NUVUIBLN2WDMZPLY52HA,1600379987521,1,False

1.0,Quality Control Issues?,"I saw an equal number of negative and positive reviews about this product, so I figured for less than $10 it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I have an audio receiver with only 1 fiber optic input, but have two devices with fiber optic outputs (Xbox 360 and Comcast HDTV Box).  While this product was designed as a splitter (i.e. taking audio from one source and sending it to two sources, like a receiver plus a set of headphones, etc.), I read several reviewers using it for dual input as I desired.<br /><br />Some reviewers reported that this item worked great, but unfortunately that was not my experience for two reasons:<br /><br />1.  I could only get one of the inputs to work consistently (i.e. one device would get audio through, while the other rarely did).  This is probably due to quality control problems (i.e. the internal components are configured correctly, so something is loose or misaligned), or the second reason that I was disappointed.<br />2.  The connections were not tight, and so the cables would pop out or jiggle, leading again to signal loss and no audio.  Obviously not what I'm shooting for, especially if I have to occasionally move the cables if I need to get behind my TV cabinet, etc.<br /><br />My guess is that this is a quality control problem / shoddy workmanship, which is why it works great for some, but not at all for others.  If you're willing to risk $10 for a 50/50 shot at a (theoretically) perfect solution to your problem, I say go for it!  I did!<br /><br />P.S. If you do buy this and happen to get one that works fine, watch out for one potential problem: both audio sources can't be on and sending audio signals at the same time (i.e. I couldn't have my Xbox and Cable Box on and transmitting sound) - obviously this would lead to either a combination of both signals being played through your receiver, distortion, or full loss of sound.  I'm not sure which.  If you're using it as a splitter, you probably would be OK because the audio signal would just be sent to two destinations, but that is just speculation on my part.  Good luck!",[],B0002MQGR2,B0002MQGR2,AFTWQCZ2NK5RKOC5Z3UBAEMAVBWQ,1211372840000,15,True

I play a game pretty often on the iPad, and it’s super apparent that the case is causing trouble with my inputs. The game will lag and either ignore my inputs or it will stutter to my gestures.

4.0,Good for the Price. missing some features,"This camera does much of what is promises to do. It's just missing some features, I didn't know I needed.<br />Firstly, it turns off pretty quickly once the car is in idol or parked with power off. It surprises me that it will also do this in ACC mode.<br />It's also not obvious how to force it to record/save. This concerns me, because I definitely want to make sure it's recording if I get pulled over for a traffic stop. (Video and Audio).<br /><br />The night vision is okay, but not amazing. Though given that you should have lights on when driving at night, it does an alright job.<br /><br />The mounting kit is great, and it's suction cup has stayed attached for more than a week without any adjustments needed.<br /><br />The audio recording does not appear to work.<br /><br />Note: when it says you need to format a card in the directions. It means put a 32gig card in the camera, and choose format from the camera menu.

5.0,Good Stuff,"Went to Fry's the other night to pick this up. I did some research beforehand online and decided to purchase the K90 at a store instead of Amazon just to ensure a good buy and to check out some of the other keyboards I was interested in. I recommend purchasing this for 30 dollars cheaper after tax (at Fry's) here on Amazon.<br /><br />First: Great keyboard, sexy look, very solid feel.<br /><br />Second: Switches are top notch, wrist rest is textured and is very comfortable, and all the buttons on the keyboard for media, win lock, lighting and profile switching are in good position and satisfying to press. Volume wheel and mute are great.<br /><br />Third: G keys (macro keys) are awesome. White lighting underneath is nice and they are a bit lower than the rest of the keyboard, which is nice.<br /><br />Software: Not troublesome for me at all. It seems like all the problems that people were having were fixed and everything is very easy to navigate now. MAKE SURE to download and install the firmware update first THEN the actual driver software. Not too difficult but easy to miss.<br /><br />Problem: Besides the ""hybrid"" issue (not all the keys are mechanical, which is annoying but not a problem for me), the lighting behind the home/end block and F keys is not too good. I don't know if it is due to the different kind of keys but the lighting is relatively dim for them. Not a huge problem, especially with the 4 separate lighting choices but annoying nonetheless.<br /><br />Overall: 5 Stars because this is the best keyboard I've owned and I'm sure I won't be switching anytime soon. Very pleased to have purchased this over my other choices.",[],B005QUQP94,B005QUQP94,AEO74A25SXO3SKFJBJFCAMJO5I4A,1346266176000,0,False

5.0,"Flat cable is easy to hide, good length, improve your speeds when compared to wireless","The Cat 7 Ethernet cable is 50 ft long and flat, making it easier to hide under the edge of your trim or carpets. It also lies against a wall better than a round cable. Cat 7 allows you to have longer cables while still providing plenty of throughput of your data. You can use this for hard wiring your gaming system, television, streaming device, etc. In fact, I highly recommend hard wiring your streaming devices and gaming consoles, as you will be much happier with the performance than if you were connected wirelessly.<br /><br />The cable comes with 20 cable clips, which is nice for mounting or securing the cable. FWIW, I do *not* recommend running this under carpet where there will be constant foot traffic. Flat or not, it is not good to put that much pressure on a cable or cord of any type.<br /><br />The only thing which gives me concern with this cable are the connectors; they could be a little higher quality. However, if you aren't plugging/unplugging them a lot, I think they will be fine. The cable tests I ran on this cable were good. I definitely would recommend this cable if it fits your needs, but remember that this is not the type of cable you want to fish inside a wall, outdoors, or anywhere that has fluctuating temperature extremes.",[],B0899DPF7T,B0899DPF7T,AGONKK5U5RWXMKO2WGLPRLOZ62UQ,1598764988128,0,False

5.0,excellent product and superb customer service,"i bought this product from amazon and received it in the mail.  when it arrived, there were missing pieces.  I reached out to amazon and they sent me another set the VERY NEXT day (today).  Thank you amazon for your responsiveness.  I returned the incomplete set.  It gets even better.  Blake (president of bodylastics) personally called me to provide me any help i needed.  He apologized for the product not being packaged properly and explained the situation and even offered to send me some free door anchors.  I declined his gracious offer.  He deserves every penny that he charges for his products.  The customer service at Bodylastics is just fantastic & i couldn't believe the Blake personally called me to sort out the situation.  If only other merchants would learn from Blake and Bodylastics.  Bodylastics is the type of company that is a pleasure to do business with.  Its the type of company that you want to tell your friends and family about because it really delivers a first class experience from start to finish.  Its rare that you find a great company that you feel privileged to do business with.<br /><br />In my opinion, Bodylastics resistance bands are the best resistance bands that money can buy.  They are the gold standard that other bands should be compared with.  They are worth much more than what Bodylastics charges for them.  They are very strong and durable.  I've used different bands for many other companies (black mountain/prosource/altus/sklz/gofit, etc) and none of them compare in terms of quality and sturdiness or price.  Bodylastics has the added security feature of DGS which prevents bands from breaking and injuring the user.  In the past, other brands bands would degrade or snap after repeated use.  When i use these bands, i never worry about them snapping and breaking.  I've actually bought bodylastics sets as gifts for my parents, sister and wife.  They also like using the bands.  They love the fact that the bands take up very little room and are light and easily storable.  The current set i bought is for my office.  The whole set takes up minimal space in my desk drawer  I bought my first set a few years ago and they still work like they are brand new.<br /><br />The bands come in different colors and weight equivalents (printed on the hook/carabiner).  You hook up one or more bands to the handles and then use those to do your exercises.  The bands can provide challenging resistance and a gym quality workout.  My apartment building has a full gym with over 30 pieces of equipment. i alternate between using the bodylastics bands and the gym equipment.  I actually prefer to use the bodylastics bands to most of the equipment in the gym.  it provides very smooth resistance and i never have to worry about dropping heavy weight on myself (ex. bench press, squat, dumbell overhead presses).  Sometimes, i use these bands in my gym ( i attach it to the pull up bar) & i frequently get people who ask me to try the bands.  When they try them, they sometimes end up buying the bands & I don't see them in the gym anymore (haha).<br /><br />I get great workouts with the bodylastic bands because they are so adjustable and can be used in unlimited ways.  When i travel, i just put them in the corner of my carry on and its doesn't take up much room or weight.  I also have the ultraAnchor and that works fantastic.  it turns my entire door into an anchoring points so that i can quickly move from exercise to exercise.<br /><br />Bodylastics has a sister website called liveexercise.com which provides thousands of exercise videos.  when you purchase a bodylastics set, you get a free subscription to that site for 3 or 6 months.  Even after the free subscription ends, you can keep subscribing for $6/month (very reasonable and about the price of a starbucks drink).  The videos are excellent and really provide a lot of great workouts.  There are strength and muscle training, toning, cardio kick box, plyometrics, and many other types of workout videos that you can stream.  I don't know how they can offer so much for such a low price???<br /><br />I have friends who spend thousands of dollars on expensive gym equipment which hogs up space in their houses.  I know others who spent thousands a year on health club memberships.  If they gave bodylastics a try, i'm sure they'd be very happy with the results and save some money and time traveling to the gym.  These bands area also great for people who are rehabilitating after surgery.  My best friend, sister and wife are physicians and they recommend these bands to their recovering patients.<br /><br />For the price and the quality, its pretty much impossible to beat Bodylastics resistance bands.  You have a company that makes superior products that charges very reasonable prices.  The company also cares about its customers and aims to deliver a superb customer service experience.  They stand behind their products.  The bands have a lifetime guarantee.  Thank you Blake and Bodylastics.  Your products have really enriched my life and the lives of those close to me.  Keep up the great work.  I'm excited to see what other fantastic products you come out with.  For those of you who have questions, feel free to leave comments and i'll be happy to answer them.  You can also buy the products directly from bodylastics website.  that should ensure more reliable shipping.",[],B006NY7PVO,B006NY7PVO,AHS7JQ5MZJPTTHVUQ5LWJ233NFCQ,1366771985000,1,True
5.0,Great camera if you know what you're looking for,"The HERO7 is a fantastic camera but it's important to know what you are looking for so that you maximize its usage and don't waste your time if you're not looking for a camera with these strengths.<br /><br />Things the camera is good for:<br /><br />1. Sports POV filming - This is probably the most advertised usage of GoPro. It still excels greatly in this area with the added benefit of insanely good imagine stabilizations that as far as I can tell, is the best in the industry right now. This means the camera is great for mounting on something and filming fast-action sports<br /><br />2. Any type of filming in which you need a very wide angle - The GoPro lenses are designed for wide-angle usage. This means that the lens' native image will produce a very wide shot. It is very useful for getting as much content from left to right in the shot as possible... It is NOT good for zooming in closely. Sure, it has a zoom feature but you're crazy if you think taking a wide angle lens like this and expecting it to be a DSLR zoom type of camera is a good idea.<br /><br />3. You need a small camera - The GoPro Hero7 is not the smallest camera in the world, and not even as small as a webcam built into your laptop or phone, BUT it is still very small and can easily fit into any pocket. This is useful to keep a low profile when filming an event - many events don't allow high-quality or non-cell phone cameras because they do not want to let professional-like footage of the event get out. Luckily, this camera is super easy to sneak into anywhere and the likelihood that someone will notice or detect this small of a camera which is also black is very slim.<br /><br />4. Great for filming concerts - It is often difficult to get a full-frame video of a concert when you are near the front of the audience or at the base of the stage. GoPros are fantastic for this because they have such a wide-angle shot. Again, they aren't a camera you want to use to zoom in closely on one individual performer, but they are fantastic at capturing wide stage and audience shots.<br /><br />5. Rugged & Waterproof - You don't have to worry about dropping or spilling anything on these. In fact, several YouTubers have used them to put into the bottom of a drinking glass and pour liquids on top of them to capture a unique shot! Try it! Also, you can place them in or around water fountains and get some cool footage that you couldn't do with a cell phone or another non-waterproof camera.<br /><br />6. The video quality is NOTICEABLY BETTER than cell phone videos. I hear the argument that GoPros aren't worth it because of the fact that many cell phones have a comparable quality camera. I've not found this to be the case at all - don't take my word for it - take a HERO7 and an iPhone to a music concert and put the HERO7 in 1080p or 4K and 60FPS, compare the footage to your iPhone and you'll see what I mean. Also, HERO7 can go way up to 240FPS which is far more frames than most cell cameras can do.<br /><br />7. A separate device - Another important factor of using a GoPro instead of a cell camera is that if you jack your cell's camera quality settings way up, you're going to eat through the memory on your phone and for longer sessions, this can quickly become an issue... Your phone has to share storage of your text messages, old photos and videos, apps, their data, etc... The GoPro is a dedicated device to handle all of this and you can pick up a 128GB microSD card here on Amazon for pretty cheap.<br /><br />8. The phone app offers a lot of remote control functionality for the device and has worked pretty flawlessly for me so far. This includes triggering shutter, live preview, live streaming to social media, playback, etc.. Its very easy to bring a set of headphones and get instant feedback on whether you are shooting with the proper settings or need to make some adjustments for sound or video using the app.<br /><br />9. You need serious image stablizition - This thing is the king of image stablization for a camera of this size. You can jump up and down, run around, move your hands, and the end-result video (as long as HyperSmooth is enabled) will look like you're just floating along with no bumps at all. They nailed it with this feature!<br />Things the camera is NOT good for:<br /><br />1.) Zooming in close - The zoom is not good enough and the lens is not designed for this<br /><br />2.) Focusing and controlling depth of field - this is virtually non-existent on the GoPro. If you're looking to control DOF, get crisp focus on a specific point in a photo or video, or do macro photography, this is the WRONG CAMERA... look at a DSLR or mirrorless and a 18-55mm and/or macro lens for this.<br /><br />3.) General photography - due to the wide-angle and almost fisheye-like qualities of the lens, I would not use this camera as a general photography camera. If you are looking for photos with a ""GoPro look"" then it is useful, but if you are looking for more standard photos like one which your cell phone or regular point-and-shoot produces, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />In conclusion, like all of the other best things in life - GoPro HERO7 is tailored for a specific usage and it blows the competition away for THAT USAGE. It is not an ""everything camera"" and folks who are looking for that or don't know what they are looking for are going to be the ones writing the negative reviews here.",[],B07GDGZCCH,B08R3D8R9W,AFX5FHSBAV5DVCD347AUUN7VKBIQ,1550535424481,4,False

As part of my job is also haul our 11 tap refrigerated beer trailer to rentals. Most of the time I am by myself so I needed a cam that would also assist my hooking up the trailer.  The instructions were clear and made installation a breeze. of the truck<br /><br />I had to mount a little unconventional as the bumper has kegs in and out  so normal mounting  wouldn't work. So I mounted on the back soide of the bumper and ran my wiring to the cab for connect to the monitor and Voila!!!.<br /><br />I am able to aim the camera right where i need to backup to be able to hook up the trailer.  This has been so helpful and stress relieving.<br />I highly recommend  this product and seller and will definately be in touch with them regarding more cams for our other trailers.,"[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+xom2K6wL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+xom2K6wL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+xom2K6wL._SL256_.jpg'}

It was pretty straight forward to install, but it was different enough from my old MB that I could not use the Windows install with new drivers. Had to completely re-install everything. Lost my Ghost capability too. MB is very fast and the shared intel CPU for graphics is faster than the dedicated graphics card with 1gb ram. Have been completely happy with it for 3 months. I do a lot of video editing. However, two days ago, while surfing, the Ethernet stopped working. I have re-installed everything, checked it on safe mode, looked through my virus scan records. but alas, the Ethernet has died. I installed a ePCI Gigabit Ethernet card which used up my only ePCI slot and it works perfectly. So not the cable or the router. I hope this MB failure is not a hint of failures to come for this MB.

5.0,Now love it,"I am an Echo user with 2 echo dots, 1 echo, 2 echo shows, and a Roav VIVA for the car.  Here is the problem.  I purchased my second Echo Show so that I could check in on my wife who spends much of her time in bed because of migraine headaches.  After some testing I found that when an Echo Show is connected to another Echo device even an Echo Connect it will output from the microphone a low level sound.  For example use drop-in on two Echo Shows and you will have to turn the volume up to hear the other person.  If you drop-in from an Echo to an Echo Show, the person speaking from the Echo Show will have a low Volume on the Echo.  The person speaking from the Echo can be hear fine on the Echo Show.  I have an Echo Connect on my phone.  If I answer with the Echo Show the person on the other end has a hard time hearing me.  If I answer on an Echo or Echo Dot the person on the phone can hear me fine.  One can make an Announcement from an Echo Show and the volume on all Echo devices will be fine, it is only when the Show is connected to another Echo device that the sound will be low.  The Echo Show if a fine device and I would give it over 5 stars if it were not for this problem.  I have spoken with support and sent feedback, but have not received an answer.  I hope someone will look into this matter and greatly improve the Echo Show.  By the way the Echo and Echo Dots have multiple microphones.  The Echo Show only has two speakers which double as a microphone.  Don’t misunderstand me, I like the Echo Show, it just has an issue.  I like that I can see my cameras and other things that you need a screen for.<br /><br />Aug. 1, 2018<br />On my original review I gave the show 3 stars because of an issue stated above.  I called home this morning and my wife asked me if I could hear her OK.  I said, “yes, why?”  She said, “I answered using the Show.”  I told her I could hear her fine (I also have my phone connected to an Amazon Connect).  I had stopped using the show to answer calls because the other person could not hear me well.  Now the show is working well with the Amazon Connect!  When I got home I went into the den and dropped into the bedroom where she was.  The volume was great.  In the past the volume of the person speaking was low when two Amazon Shows were used for Drop-in.  Amazon has now corrected that problem and the Amazon Show plays well with all devices!  I can now set in my living room and control about everything in my house.  As my wife has medical problems I have Shows, Dots, and Echoes scattered around different rooms of the house in case she has a problem.  I am a big fan of the Amazon devices.

Yes.<br />I wasn't looking for something to replace my laptop, just something I could get online with, email, play games, etc. This Kindle Fire is perfect for all that.<br />The browser has been pretty fast. Obviously, I think a lot of it has to do with your wi-fi signal, or lack thereof. I am a huge Amazon junkie anyways, but it was awesome watching Sons of Anarchy on this thing. I took it to the library and was flying around the Internet on a very strong wi-fi signal.<br />Again, its not perfect, and it's not an iPad killer. It just works.

4.0,"Ultimately worked, but I had to also swap the drive logic boards","I bought this because our WII U stopped recognizing WII discs. I followed the iFixIt tutorial that you can find on the web and installed it in the WII U. When I powered up the console, I got an ""Error code: 160-1402"" message. A little bit of Googling led me to understand that you can't simply swap drives... each WII U console will only recognize a specific drive. The solution is to swap the logic boards between the two drives. There's a YouTube video called ""WII U Drive Board Swap"" that demonstrates this process, and that gave me some confidence to try it out. So now, I do have a console that works fully -- both WII U and original WII games now load. But it was not as simple as I initially thought when I purchased this. I suppose that's not a fault of the product, it's a fault of the WII U itself, so I can't really complain too too much.",[],B00XVIYLOY,B00XVIYLOY,AH6ZE7ITUNXAAPPCC7NYPYWCMAYQ,1566944657199,0,True

Until the latest Roku or Android updates, I didn't need a hub to screen cast any content from my Android phones and tablets. I think this has more to do with streaming movies to TVs from unlimited data phone plans, than actual technical solutions. For whatever reasons our ability to cast streaming services using mobile devices (phones and Mobil tablets) is no longer supported. This is not the fault of this Hub. So  this hub probably deserves a 5 Star rating, just don't expect it to be a wired workaround for the screen casting limitations of your phone or TV.

5.0,Sangean DT-110: One fine pocket radio,"Having owned the Sangean DT-110, the Sangean DT-200VX as well as the Sony SRF-37V, I can readily say that I like all three pocket radios very much. All three are PLL (Phase locked loop) digitally synthesized receivers.<br /><br /> This is how they rank in my opinion:<br /><br />1) Best AM: Almost a tie between the SRF-37V and the DT-200VX.<br /><br />2) Best FM: Almost a tie between the DT-110 and the DT-200VX<br /><br />3) Radio controls: The DT-110 and the DT-200VX both have a stereo/monaural switch (bandwidth control) for detecting weaker FM stations whereas the SRF-37V has a DX/local RF (Radio frequency) gain switch for FM, TV and Weatherband signals. Personally I think that the stereo/mono switch is far superior to the DX/local switch for receiving the weaker FM signals (when set to mono and NOT to stereo). The DX/local switch on the other hand is much better for reception in large cities (when set to local and NOT DX) so that the RF gain of the unit is lowered when trying to receive very strong local signals on nearly the same frequency that strongly interfere with each other. Thus depending on where you live, work or play will ultimately determine which specific radio with which type of switch control you may want to purchase.<br /><br />All three have lock/hold switches for keeping the settings fixed except for the analog volume control switch. In addition, the lock switch on the DT-110 must be set to ""on"" when changing the batteries (you have up to 2 minutes which should be more than adequate) so that the presets won't be lost. The Sangean radios both have fine sounding deep bass boost switches whereas the Sony does not (it appears however that on the Sony a small amount of deep bass boost is always on and cannot be turned off). Also, the Sony is always in stereo mode for FM reception and sounds fine as well. All three radios sound the best with better earphones or earbuds than are supplied with the units which is not too surprising, but I found the Sony headphones adequate for most purposes. Also, all three receivers can achieve quite strong volume output levels before significant distortion occurs.<br /><br />4) All three radios are very well constructed with the Sony probably the most rugged design. The DT-200VX as well as the Sony have a hinged battery door (the Sony's door can be forced to come off however) and also seems well built, but a few people have talked about the DT-200VX breaking if it was dropped. The DT-110 does not have a hinged battery compartment at all, but it also seems to be well built. The DT-110 comes with a small, tightly fitting slip case with a belt clip attached to the case (in addition the specially designed case was constructed so that the radio can be completely operated very efficiently without ever taking it out of the case at all, except of course for changing the batteries). The Sony MRF-37V and the DT-200VX both have a removable belt clip that attaches to the radios and neither of them come with a case. Both the SRF-37V and the DT-110 fit very nicely however in the zippered Micro hard shell case, HS-5, by Sakar (available online or also available at many stores nationwide). This hard shell case is not very expensive, but also provides a great deal of protection against breakage if the units were dropped.<br /><br />5) Presets:<br /><br />  DT-110: 24 total- 15 on FM, 6 on AM and 3 random (priority settings). Except for its 3 priority settings that require a single key press, it is a little harder (2 key presses, one with a time delay, instead of one on the Sony) to directly and quickly choose a loaded preset. However an automatic scan/seek capability, APS (automatic scanning for and loading presets and seeking sufficiently strong stations) can be used to either load presets for the first time or even scanning for previously chosen presets.<br />  DT-200VX: 19 total on any band in any order (called My Favorites), but they are found only in a forward progression without the ability to go in reverse. An APS procedure can also be used to setup presets on any band quickly and automatically.<br />  SRF-37V: 25 total- 5 on FM1 and 5 on FM2, 5 on AM, 5 on TV and 5 on Weatherband. It is extremely simple to setup presets and to retrieve them, but tuning is not an automatic procedure and requires single adjustments or the tunning button can of course be held down to speed up the scanning process.<br /><br />6) Power:<br /><br />  DT-110: 2 AAA: up to 20 hrs on FM and 30 hrs on AM.<br />  DT-200VX: 2 AA: up to 30 - 40 hrs<br />  SRF-37V: 1 AAA: 31 on TV or Weatherband, up to 34 on FM and 54 on AM.<br /><br />7) The DT-110 (now under $35 at Amazon plus shipping, but is now as much as $50 elsewhere) and the DT-200VX (now under just $50 on Amazon including shipping) are much higher priced than the Sony (now under $29 plus shipping on Amazon) and have only 90 day warranties whereas the Sony has a limited one year warranty.<br /><br />8) Best overall: I live in a rural area in the high mountains of New Mexico so for my location the stereo/mono switch is superior for improving the weaker FM signals (see my note on this above). Thus, for my location and for working around computers and in heavy RF (radio frequency) noise environments (such as fluorescent lighting, electric motors, etc.) either indoors or outdoors, I really like the DT-110 the best for the great stability of the FM signals and its ability to detect weaker FM signals (it does not have a clock, but it does have a 90 minute automatic shutoff timer). I like the Sony SRF-37V the best outdoors and it is also mostly ok indoors (which comes with a clock, but no automatic shutoff). For all around use if you require a small speaker as well as earphone listening, probably the DT-200VX is the best (with both a clock and an automatic shutoff), but all Sangean pocket radios mute during automatic scanning and seeking which makes it much harder to find weaker stations on AM or FM very easily except using a manual and thus a more tedious search procedure.<br /><br />For more details, please also see my separate reviews of the DT-200VX and the SRF-37V.",[],B0000226IH,B0000226IH,AGGSFZ3D63SU222LF5HJDJOJZAEQ,1206160279000,16,True

5.0,A Unique Manual Focus Lens for the Creative Artist Photographers,"This is my 4th Lensbaby lens and I can't be happier with it. I love being able to control the creative blur in the lens as I'm taking the photos and being able to see the results instantly when using my digital camera. True, blur can be added in post-production but not like I've seen this lens do. Not only can I control the blur with the built-in ""arms"" in front of the lens, I can vary the tilt of the lens, forcing a bit of perspective but not like the old 4x5 cameras. This is just a subtle hint of tilt to aid in the blur but if you don't want to tilt, lock the lens and use it as a straight 45mm manual lens. If you are just starting out in Lensbaby, this is a good, less expensive starter lens but still packed with much potential for creativity. I've had my lens for nearly 6 months and at first it took a little getting used to but overall it's a fun lens! It's small, compact, light and unobtrusive for street photography. And it's such a unique design that I've even been asked ""where's the actual lens??"" Its metal and glass construction is sturdy and well built and will last for years. The smooth, sensitive focus takes a bit to get accustomed to compared to other manufacturer's manual lenses but it's still just as good.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719So-XgUQL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719So-XgUQL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719So-XgUQL._SL256_.jpg'}

4.0,Not bad for a cheap MP3 Player,"A lot of the reviews are negative for this little device, but since getting it at Christmas as a gift I like it. It does what I need it to do, which is to be able to listen to the radio while working out at the gym. I myself have only put a few songs on it, but playing them seems simple enough. Not enough on there to use the shuffle feature like some people have complained about, so I haven't used that and cannot comment on that feature. But seeing how this is my first MP3 Player, it's good enough for me. No need for fancy bells and whistles. Keeping it simple is best for a newbie like me.<br />Complaints about battery life and charging seem unfounded. I can get several hours of use out of this and charging is not an issue. You have to charge this with the device ON and not off. The only thing that bothers me is that once plugged into my USB port on my desktop I cannot see the screen on the MP3 Player as it's upside down. I chalk that one up to bad design.<br />I haven't used the ear buds that came with it so I cannot comment on them, only that they are the solid plastic ones and past experience told me not to wear them as they are uncomfortable in my ears. I was bought a pair of after market ones to go with this and the sound is just find and comfortable.<br />The clip that comes with it is darn near impossible to get off if you want to remove it. I thought we would break it trying and three of us took turns at it. It finally came off and I've been afraid of putting it back on, IF I can even do it.<br />Instructions are typical of most things you buy these days. Totally useless.

1.0,Not ready for prime time.,"The wife bought one a few months back and likes it. So I bought two (dual monitors)<br /><br />She never told me that when clicking on a video (any one. avi, mov, mkv etc.) the screen goes black for about 2 sconds or so. And when you close the video... black again for the 2 seconds or so. Since she works with text mainly it's not a big deal for her. But I work in graphics and video. Major PITA.<br /><br />Hanns wants info so they can get them serviced but if it's the same with all 3 I doubt even replacing them will help.<br /><br />Also interesting is that you don't get a DVI cable with them. Which I find odd since it does have a DVI port. Just comes with a vga and a DVI to HDMI. When I first plugged them in, the old DVI cables I had on the old monitors (an asus and a samsung) wouldn't work.

3.0,I like that comes with a storage pouch,"Let's start with the pros.<br />I like that comes with a storage pouch.<br />It comes with a LED Light.<br />It comes with a USB CABLE.<br />I can photograph very small items for products.<br />It comes with a white drop back and a black one.<br /><br />The Cons.<br />No Plug adapter. I don't care what you sell, if you have it come with a USB cable, you should also include adapter.<br />NO INSTRUCTIONS.  Totally unacceptable. It took me forever to figure this out and it took forever because the magnet on the right side doesn't work. (see photos). Instructions also would be great so I can figure out why there are two holes on the back drops.<br />The corners at the bottom show.  (See photo) Sure, I could fold the back drop long ways, but then it's messy (see photo).<br />I don't know if the seller is the manufactures these, if they do, please, I picked yours out of your competition because yours was more expensive, hoping it would be better quality, the material is similar to poster board, the drop backs are similar to soft foam, these are not expensive materials.  please work on this and make this better.  It would also be nice to see this come in different sizes.<br /><br />I do want to note, this did come very fast, so my feedback reflects the product and not the seller (if the seller didn't manufacture it)<br /><br />Note: The instructions to contact the seller on Amazon need updated.  Here it says to https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/help/id=537800 click the contact button, there is no contact button as you can see on the photos I uploaded.

3.0,Disappointing,"I had been holding off on getting an alarm clock that will also charge my iphone and play music off my iphone because of all the negative reviews.  I took a chance on this product and regret it.<br />I was specifically looking for an alarm clock that could be dimmed all the way to black and had 2 alarms that could be set:  one for weekdays and one for weekneds.  This one does that, however, my weekend alarm never goes off even though it's set to ON.  You HAVE to set the alarm using your phone, which is a pain in the neck.  Also, it's not easy to tell if the alarm is set by looking at the clock itself.  It is hard to determine what the volume of the alarm will be when it actually goes off in the morning too.  Then, to top it all off, this thing is bluetooth ennabled, but any time I take my phone out of the bedroom, and return, I have to make it forget the device and re-pair the stupid thing.  What a pain.<br /><br />On the good side, it sounds great when playing music through it.<br /><br />I'm packing the stupid thing up and sending it back.  When you pay $200 for something, you don't expect to have this many issues with it.

They did not care one bit about the black marks inside the screen nor the fact that the screen wouldnt lower or raise.  even the remote is reversed...  they only want to know if anyone checked their FAQ and youtube searches to see if anyone touched the tension screws.  this is how this company works it seems.  if you have an issue you best not touch anything!!!  what a joke....<br /><br />UPDATE!!!

3.0,Shoddy documentation knocks off 2 stars,"The $10 I saved versus buying the Adafruit 128x64 display is offset several times over by the 2.5 hours I spent getting the example code to compile.  My trial and error process is documented at the end of the review.  I'm still very new to Arduino, but have decent experience developing in C/C++.  I have no qualms with needing to do some manual installation and confguration, but the directions need to be better than this.  Unless I'm building a lot of an item and need the parts much cheaper, I'll likely stick to Adafruit or others with better documentation/support.<br /><br />I did realize before buying that the top section is only yellow and the bottom section is only blue, but the gap between those sections comes as a surprise.  It's not a deal killer, but would be nice if that was noted in the description.<br /><br />--Using directions in IIC_OLED.zip file downloaded from the link in the description (md5sum: 538d90a29b4a8d8490e1f2c6f173be0a)<br />--For 0.96 inch, copied Adafruit_SSD1306.h and Adafruit_GFX.h into new folders in my Arduino/libraries<br />--Compile failed, many undefined reference errors from linker.

Of course, the one thing the directions were right about is that it won't work with them.<br />--Finally decided to install the DIYMall files in separate directories in the libraries folder, but of course that generated errors that it didn't know which Adafruit_SSD1306.h file to use.<br />--Rather than get rid of the Adafruit libraries just to use their one-off version, I renamed the files to DIYMall_SSD1306 and DIYMall_GFX, and changed the #include lines in cpp (and one header) files to point to the correct headers, and finally it worked.",[],B00O2LLT30,B083QB4T1P,AHNO6DISARWBO72L3GOCWQY5UXRQ,1503559203497,2,True

5.0,Another Amazing Maven Product.,"Another amazing product by the best. Incredible product. Just got mine in and they are perfect. Cant wait to use these this season. Maven Optics are an addiction. Im an avid sportsman and most of my life I lacked a good pair of optics. I spent tons of money on clothing and other objects to amplify my outdoor experience, I just never knew where the line of quality met price when it came to optics. I was always unsure on what needed to be spent on optics to get the best performance without overpaying for a name brand optic. After my first pair of Mavens it was understood. I have put my Mavens next to the top competitor optics owned by friends and every single response I get is the same. &#34;Wow&#34; they are all shocked that they paid often almost double the money, for an optic that barely stands next to Maven. They then sit there and switch back and forth between the Mavens and the competitor overpriced optics and say the same thing. The Mavens are better. They feel better. They the clarity is better. The PRICE IS WAY BETTER. Same exact quality lens and optical performance, but more precision in the design of the Mavens. I am not saying the overpriced competitor optics are not great. Im saying the Mavens are incredible. You get more performance out of your optic for your dollar. You will not be disappointed with any set of Maven Optics. I also have a set of the B.2 and B.3s. I now spend majority of my hunt glassing with my Binos. I bring them everywhere with me. I just completed my Grand Slam Turkey Series with 2 Osceolas in South Florida, 2 Rios in Texas, 2 Missouri Easterns, 3 Kansas Rios, and my Wyoming Merriam. I had my Mavens with me the entire time. Once you get a pair of Mavens you feel naked in the woods without them. I have never used binos while turkey hunting until I purchased Mavens. Now I do not leave the truck without them. Most will probably never read this comment, but for those looking for an incredible product with amazing customer service and tired of over paying for optics, Maven is your answer. Be confident in your purchase and your optics. Good luck out there boys!","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YwqVwU6wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YwqVwU6wL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YwqVwU6wL._SL256_.jpg'}

A strong indicator that the internal wiring close to the lightning connector has been severed. It was barely purchased just a few months ago. Bad quality.

4.0,I SUGGEST YOU BUY TWO!!!,"Just purchased my second one. Not because the first one failed, but because I am a clumsy oaf who drinks too much.<br /><br />The greatest feature about this keyboard, that I'm sure it shares with any other mechanical keyboard of quality, is that it is washable. I'm not talking about a light spritz with some febreeze and a wipe down, I'm talking unplug it and put it in the sink with a scrub brush.<br /><br />I am a recent convert from laptops, and this keyboard alone has saved me over $1000 (2 laptops). Two spills, one more of a slurry of the day's meals brought on by alcohol, the other due to excessive gesturing, also brought on by alcohol. In the first, I popped all the keys and ran it under the sink with a light scrubbing to remove stuck on... particles... The second, Jack and Coke as I was gesticulating at my girlfriend's inability to see that guy to the left in COD that I was pointing right at, only required a preliminary wash down/out (yes, I flooded the entire thing with water and let it drain out the cracks).<br /><br />Now, I don't recommend this course of action. Obviously the best way would be NOT to spill things. But it's a computer. It's probably by your TV. You probably drink sodas and whatever while your'e playing/watching stuff. My thought process was that if the alternative is to have to throw it out and get a new one, why not try something that has the potential to destroy it. I guess I got lucky.<br /><br />Long story short, coke is sticky. As soon as the new one gets here the old one'll go into a bath of hot water and dawn. I don't like being unable to use the PC while my keyboard dries for the appropriate 2-3 days, so I'll just swap them out when I inevitably loose bodily control through whatever concoction I'm under the influence of that night.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very Cleanable<br />Keys feel good, response is good.<br />LED&#34;s are dimmable<br />Metal front<br />clackityclackityclackity<br /><br />Cons:<br />During night time gaming LED's are a bit bright.<br />As I&#34;m not a professional gamer (LoL and some Steam stuff), I hardly notice any improvement in response time or other benefits.<br />&#34;Special programmable keys&#34; are limited to your PC's &#34;Default Programs&#34; list for things like email and browser.",[],B00OBA6QYY,B012SPKAUY,AETCM2H45G5I2KTJ3VBVD56RB4QA,1431457359000,0,True

4.0,A good budget tablet monitor,"This tablet was purchased in June 2019 and as of late December 2019 I'm leaving this review. Any changes to the function or my satisfaction with the product afterward may or may not warrant an update from me.<br /><br />As for now, I'm happy with what I got. This is a good budget tablet in competition with the Wacom brand, which can go for multiple thousands of dollars, and watching the artist community run in to more and more problems with their Cintiqs made me steer clear from purchasing one. I stuck with my reliable Wacom Bamboo Fun tablet, which is without screen, and made use out of it for about a decade. As I was first trained using traditional media, I needed a tablet that would solve the problems I was having with the coordination between my hands on the tablet and eyes on a monitor; so I saved up for something like this.<br /><br />Mine is used on a Windows 10 desktop, using Clip Studio Paint Pro and Adobe Photoshop CS5.<br /><br />Pros of the XP-PEN 15.6 Drawing Monitor:<br />- I can easily see what I'm drawing, right below my hand<br />- Pressure sensitivity is responsive<br />- Handy function buttons for quick, easy, and rapid-fire CTRL-Z. Also buttons to adjust the brightness of the display.<br />- The control program that comes with it is good for customization of function buttons and adjusting pressure input to get the natural feeling you need for your illustration workflow.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The black half-glove is too big for my small hands. The excess fabric combined with bulky seams can make it frustrating for those with sensory issues. I'm not inclined to use the full coverage gloves and have no opinion on them.<br />- The pen holder base is great if you don't accidentally bump your desk a little. My pen has been known to fly off of it at the slightest jostle, from both standing and resting positions.<br />- The description says it comes with 8 replacement pen nibs, but unfortunately mine did not come with them. Make absolutely sure yours comes with what is stated in the description. This one was a bummer, because the tablet vastly increased my productivity and will wear down my one single nib faster than before.<br /><br />Not really problems on the part of the tablet but something to keep in mind:<br />- Newer graphics/video cards are transitioning to DP ports nowadays, so make sure your computer either has an extra unused HDMI port for this tablet, or get a DP to HDMI adapter.<br />- The tablet does NOT come with a stand. I purchased an adjustable-height mesh stand for the tablet to rest on as I work. It also does NOT come with screw holes to mount it on an adjustable arm.<br />- The power button does not respond to light presses. I have to press harder than I prefer to make sure it receives the signal to turn the tablet display on.<br />- Make sure to use the tablet's included software to calibrate your pen accuracy!<br /><br />Overall I am satisfied with this product. As I stated above, my productivity is at an all-time high and improvements to my style and workflow are noticeable. I just wish the extra nibs had made it in to the tablet's box.",[],B079ZXM3Q7,B079ZXM3Q7,AHBN5S3AMGVCHF3D45BRN5MHQIJA,1577083898965,0,True

5.0,Great phone for the price!,"So, I purchased this phone when there were no more in stock. I didn't realize that until I bought it but I think I was smart by doing that.

It was supposed to arrive almost a month later because they weren't going to be in stock for 2 to 3 weeks from my purchase date in early March. I did end up getting my phone about 10 days later which is nice, I didn't pay for shipping I almost never do and opted out for free shipping. The phone was great when I received it. No damages, no missing parts, no scratches, perfectly working condition. So far I've had it for about a week and runs smoothly on AT&T, it was a little tricky to open up the SIM slot with the little tool, I took it to an AT&T retailer for them to handle that for me. It took longer to transfer my info from my old phone to this new phone on Samsung sharing that it did to actually turn on, install the SIM Card and my SD chip. So far the battery is awesome, it lasts a really long time. Especially right now where we are stuck at home I am on it a little more than usual. The charger is awesome, it's lightning fast and I can't brag enough about this phone. It has features I haven't even tapped into and am in awe each time I discover a new one.

5.0,Perfect mouse,"I got my Arc Touch just earlier this week, but I have to say I love it. I've always been quite picky over my mice, usually going for very high-end (and expensive) mice, but I took a risk with this one, and it paid off. The Arc touch is very sleek and stylish, comfortable and very easy to carry around with you. If you're someone who uses a laptop for work or college, or travels a lot, this is the perfect mouse for you. Or even if you just want a simple and elegant mouse for your home computer, its great for everything. To turn it on and off you simply bend the mouse. Once it is bent, it turns on. When flattened, it turns off. It uses a micro-USB reciever which can be plugged into your computer and forgotten about. It barely sticks out, and doesn't interfere with anything. If you want to remove it, simply flatten your mouse and place it on the underside where the magnet is and you won't have to give it a second thought. The magnet is quite strong and the receiver will not fall off unless you remove it yourself. I love this feature because I always lose USB drives.<br /><br />So, on to the mouse itself.<br /><br />The back half of the mouse is a soft rubber-like material which feels comfortable and allows you to get a good grip on the mouse. The buttons are made of a shiny black plastic, and the scroll wheel is more or less just a touchpad like you'd find on a laptop. Scrolling is very nice with this mouse. While there is no actual wheel, the mouse vibrates making it feel as if there was an actual physical mouse wheel which was a really nice feature. One thing I learned quite fast was that you really need the driver to get the most out of this mouse. Once you have IntelliPoint downloaded from Microsoft you can customize what your middle button does when you tap it. You can set it for just about anything you could possibly need. Very useful to have that capability. The middle button really makes up for the lack of other buttons other mice normally have. It's really a 3-in-1 button. I could go on but all you really need to know is scrolling is fantastic with this product.<br /><br />Overall it is very comfortable and performs perfectly. The curve of the mouse fits my hand very nicely (it is a bit small for me, but still very comfortable), and very easy to use. You don't need to have any kind of mouse pad for this to work either, it glides smoothly over almost any surface you'd ever use a mouse on without any issues. You can even use it on glass with nothing behind it! I don't want to make this review too long so I'll just do a Pro-Con list to finish this off.<br /><br />PROS:<br />~ Very sleek look<br />~ Very comfortable curve, and material<br />~ Works on almost any surface<br />~ Very portable<br />~ Weight is very light, but is also a very sturdy mouse<br />~ Strong magnetic underside to the mouse to hold USB reciever<br />~ Can be used for anything including playing computer games (albeit not the best gaming mouse in comparison)<br /><br />CONS:<br />~ Clicking takes a little to get used to. At the very tip of the mouse it takes almost no pressure to click the right/left buttons, but towards the middle you need to press fairly hard to get a click. You always have to have your fingertips on the top of the buttons to get easy clicks. I got used to this quickly, though.<br />~ No forward or back buttons. You can only program the middle button double-tap to go Forward or Back, not both.<br />~ Price. The normal price is something like $70, which is quite steep for this mouse. I paid $42 here on Amazon, and I would not go higher than that.<br />~ At times the middle button is very sensitive, which results in the double-tap feature going off accidentally.",[],B003UT6C9G,B003UT6C9G,AHUTDDG6XMECSODM6V7CHHWV64NQ,1304909432000,1,True

The seams are well constucted so you won't have to worry about them splitting when inserting your vinyl like some of the cheaper brands. But being new to vinyl collecting, one thing that I learned without even knowing I needed to learn it is that these sleeves are just deep enough to cover your entire album with no extra length at the opening. I know now that some plastic outer sleeves are deeper where there can be up to an inch of extra length after you've inserted the album. Some collectors like to fold this over and tape the sleeve closed. I on the other hand like that there's no extra depth so when I realized that this is what I got I was pleasantly surprised. So keep this in mind before you order these sleeves and like I said they are a good quality sleeve, heavy-duty with strong seams and I'm completly satisfied with them.",[],B000RA7IZS,B000RA7IZS,AHLAKZKH77OGWZUMFKK7MMRNT7KA,1359550821000,1,True

I came across this monitor and from everything I read I decided to finally make the purchase. I am so glad I did!!!  I have already sent the link to co-workers, family and friends.  This monitor took about 2 minutes to get it up and working.  The first day I used it I sat outside with my laptop to work, it was a very sunny day and I am happy to say I could see the screen without any glare or issue.  Inside or outside it works great.  It is super light, the case works as a stand and protective cover and it is so easy to set up.  I can't say enough positive about this great portable monitor!",[],B099JPSLZM,B0BV6T8J1T,AHGUWFAQVPO5IGSROPB7YY2MX26A,1655688214539,1,True

So I install the lens turret to look at my slides under the B/C lenses (did not actually realize all 3 aren't on the turret together) and this is when I discover that the turret does not actually rotate the lenses. The only way I can use them is to manually unscrew and swap them into location. My specimen looks fine through the B lens, but the C lens absolutely can't find a focus point. I wrote to Andonstar through amazon, and they quickly responded requesting videos of these problems. I sent Customer Support 3 videos to show them that the turret doesn't rotate the lenses, that I can see my image in the B lens, and that I can't see my image in the C lens. They responded that I actually needed to email Customer Sales.

The sound quality is great (compared to other bluetooth headphones I've tried) and the bright blue makes them easy to find in a bag, car, or in a pile of clothes without looking neon and distracting while they're in use. The battery life is AMAZING.<br />Mine came with a nice quality arm band/pouch/wallet thing that is also nice and high quality (and reversible with a reflective side for running, etc in low light)<br />The only thing i DON'T like about them is that the wire is supposed to &#34;float&#34; behind your neck, so they can get uncomfortable if you have long hair that pulls the wire down and you basically wear them non-stop. Wearing a ponytail, having short hair (in back), or not wearing them day and night will prevent this.

Once the Kindle is inserted into the Tuff-Luv, the keyboard and the function keys on the side and bottom of the Kindle are all completely accessible, and the screen is fully on view. There is a snap-closed cover that protects the screen and keyboard when the Kindle is not in use.<br /><br />When I am using my Kindle, the snap cover can double as a book stand, which is extremely handy. It also has three positions, so I can tilt the Kindle for viewing at the angle that suits me best.<br /><br />The case is light and slim and easily fits into a purse, backpack, briefcase or suitcase. And as an added plus it is just plain cute! I personally love the color red, which is why I bought this version. It is a lovely, bright, clear red. The finish has the soft shine of well-maintained leather shoes, and it looks just like real leather, even though it is ""faux.""<br /><br />I highly recommend this case to any Kindle 3 owner who is looking for a sturdy, reliable, attractive cover to protect your Kindle.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31D4lf1kV9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31D4lf1kV9L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31D4lf1kV9L._SL256_.jpg'}

I replaced batteries, tinkered with my router settings, moved the scale around, etc. Anything I tried resulted in an error. It finally completed the setup after about 2 hours of this, and to this day I don't know what was different about what I did that made it finally complete the setup. But here's the kicker: once I got on the scale, it always displayed &#34;err&#34;. I emailed Fitbit support (there is NO phone support) and a few hours later I received an email telling me to return the scale because it was defective. I was already hesitant to spend so much money on a scale, and the whole experience convinced me to get a regular body fat scale and forget the whole wifi hi-tech thing... it's way more trouble than it's worth.

5.0,Flawless Operation,"I use this for my real estate business and social media and it does what you expect from it. I needed a gimbal that supported a larger device (LG V60 ThinQ) and it has no trouble supporting it even with a case on. It stays very stable and has easy to use buttons on it. My one gripe is that there is a zoom in/out switch on the left side of the handle, which is designed for someone who is holding it with their right hand. I'm a lefty and hold it with my left so zooming can be a bit awkward. For future designs, I would recommend all buttons be placed on the front side of the device to accommodate everyone. Regardless of that design flaw, I still love the device and the companion software. There is a tracker built into the DJI app that will allow the gimbal to follow your face when recording video if you have it on a tripod. Works really well for that.

On one door, the vertical part of the door frame was set back from the door about an inch. I had to do a buildup on the door to get the magnet to line up properly. The motion detector works very well, but after I received, I started wondering how to mount them.

Certainly not the claimed 10m or 30 ft. With clear line of sight, I heard distortion and skipping/lag at approximately 20 feet, and significantly less with any obstruction. Perhaps the most egregious problem with this speaker has to do with it's speakerphone capabilities. I received a call while testing the speaker and the party at the other end of the call had a very difficult time hearing me. I found myself yelling within inches of the speaker for the other party to hear me. They claimed it sounded very distant, possibly as if I were under water.

They said the technology just isn't good enough for a small solar charger to cherge only by the sun just like our adapters that came with our phones. You put it out in the sun whenever you can to add to whatever charge you got otherwise (""top off"" they say).<br /><br />So I told my boss about the environmentally-friendly materials and the green-minded outlook of the co. and that they ""also had solar"" and that was good enough for him.

5.0,Amazing looking and functioning motherboard,"I got this for my first PC build, since my previous PC (a prebuilt CyberPower one) had an MSI motherboard that I had no issues with and was very functional. It was very easy to install, looks great, and the BIOS is very user friendly. I had no problem tinkering with my fan settings and speeding up my RAM. It also automatically overclocks my CPU to a safe speed when in high use to get more performance but not risk stability issues.<br /><br />However, I am disappointed by the LED's. My PC was built with a black/red theme, which was inspired by this motherboard in the first place, so I was hoping that the LED's would provide some nice ambient light that matched the rest of the computer. But they're simply too small/low power to do much of anything. Thankfully, my case (Phanteks P400S) came with a LED strip that compensates.<br /><br />First picture is with flash to show the motherboard, with the case's LED strip turned on. Second picture is no flash, case's LED strip turned off, to show the motherboard's LEDs.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wuyx3sorL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wuyx3sorL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wuyx3sorL._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,Upgraded up from old Sounddock -- EASY Setup!,"I've always loved Bose products. They are reliable, last a long time, and live up to their reputation as high quality sound devices. Previous to my purchase of the SoundTouch 20, I was using an old original Sounddock that docked with my original iPhone back in 2007-2008. Since then, I have been using it with adapters to make it work with the newest iPhones. All through that, my old Sounddock was a champ! I mention this to demonstrate that Bose products do last a long time. That is what I think justifies the higher upfront cost.<br /><br />When it came time to upgrade I considered getting the newest Sounddock. However, I was swayed to get a SoundTouch 20 instead because of the ability to play my iTunes library, Pandora, and even local stations that broadcast online without having to hook up my iPhone, thus saving my iPhone battery. My iPhone can stay in my pocket (or apron pocket while cooking and cleaning in the kitchen), where it's easier to grab when I receive a text or a phone call. And I can use the app of my iPhone to control the SoundTouch. The mere convenience of this is awesome! I also love that if I do want to stream music from my iPhone I can simply use AirPlay. AirPlay from the phone is great because it stops the music when you receive a call.<br /><br />The sound quality of the SoundTouch 20 is amazing! I expected it to be as great as my original Sounddock and I think it's even better. The sound is more full and, as they say, it &#34;fills the room&#34; without seeming loud.<br /><br />Setup was a dream. I'm a pretty techy person to begin with, but I think it would be very simple even for someone not as familiar with setting up wifi devices. From out of the box to listening to a Pandora station was only about 20 minutes, and that included waiting 15 minutes for updates.<br /><br />If you're oscillating between a Sounddock or a SoundTouch system, I would recommend investing a bit more and getting the SoundTouch. :)",[],B00FF1VCVK,B00FS2RRJM,AFVKVBNP44VTFK7EKNVUFUUYV6EQ,1408470749000,9,False

5.0,Fits the G15 as it should.,"This is a Quality adapter and an OEM Canon part. And it was a bit hard to find.<br /><br />I use it to attach a macro flash for perfectly lit closeup shots. Because the G15 is a newer model, there's no generic adapters for the G15 made yet. At least I can't find any. The generics are usually 1/3 the price of OEM.<br /><br />However,<br />Canon & Nikon, like other camera companies, have a habit of changing the fitment of their camera accessories with each new model of camera. Seems like they want you to buy all new accessories when you upgrade your camera.<br /><br />For example...I have bought 3 of these things: One for the G9 (52mm), one for the G10 & G11 (52mm also, but different bayonet mount), and this one for the G15 (58mm AND a different bayonet mount). They all look the same and about the same physical size, but are not interchangeable between some models for those reasons.<br /><br />Also, this one went to a 58mm end thread, which actually forced me to buy a whole new macro flash device (Meike FC100) because my old florescent ringlight (Samigon FRL-1), which has a strange 48.5mm? proprietary thread size and it's impossible to find a 58mm adapter for that. It comes with 3 adapters, 49mm, 52mm, & 55mm, and there is no contact with that company to even ask if they have a 58.<br /><br />Same thing with batteries.

5.0,Let's You Be in Control,"To my mind, a camera should be a tool, not a participant. I love this camera, because it does whatever you tell it to do, and doesn't frustrate you with a lot of &quot;smart&quot; features. I had a 35mm camera once with &quot;autofocus&quot;-- so-called &quot;point-and-shoot,&quot; and it drove me crazy, because half the time, it didn't focus on what I actually wanted in the picture.<br />This camera gives the user total control of light, aperture and zoom. In addition, because there's no film involved, you can shoot day or night without having to worry about the speed of you film. And by the way, it takes great twilight and night pictures!<br />All the adjustments are two handed, so it's like liquid; you don't have to adjust and check, adjust and check, go back and adjust again, etc. It's a quicker way to what you want.<br />Now I'll admit that's a personal preference; it's like stick shift vs. automatic-- some people are passionate about one or the other. Some people love point-and-shoot. If you're one, then this probably isn't the camera for you.<br />The camera has 5 megapixel resolution, which means that you can print poster size reproductions of your shots, or crop tiny portions, enlarge then, and have them look really good. This is a photoshop type of camera, a camera for someone who likes to play with images.<br />There are a few drawbacks:<br />It takes almost a minute for the picture to store, so if you want to take photojournalistic shots, like athletes in action, hitting the shutter as fast as you can move your finger, this isn't the right camera.<br />Also, as with just about any computer tool, you have to buy accessories. It comes with two alkaline batteries, which struck me as strange, because I didn't think that could be sufficient, but I thought &quot;Hey, if the manufacture includes them....&quot; I was right the first time. Fortunately, I already had some NiMH rechargeables, and they last for 60-70 shots. There's an adapter for indoor use as well, although I don't have one. You're going to want to buy an additional memory card too. I got the Viking 128 meg CF, and I like it.<br />Because of the high resolution, e-mailing or posting images takes a long time, and people who receive them will have a long wait on the download. Of course you can always print the image, and then scan it in, which is what I've done. Believe it or not, the scanned images from this camera actually look better than scanned actual photographs. This is probably because I've played with them, and gotten them to look good on screen before I've printed them. I've also used the highest quality photo-finish paper I could find.<br />I'm very happy with this camera. A camera is an individual thing, though. Before you buy, think through exactly what you want, and buy the camera that suits you. If you want outdoor nature shots and architectural shots at all times of day and night, portrait shots, and candid shots, and want to print them as album photos, and want to be able to crop, adjust color, and cut and paste, this is a great camera.",[],B00005MA7J,B00005MA7J,AHY6GQXD3CBN46V67AFYKYTJFVHA,1006452333000,55,False
