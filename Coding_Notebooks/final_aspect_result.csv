190,5.0,Way better than I expected,"These are way nicer than I expected.  I purchased a pair of $175 earbuds and lost one of them, and found out I could not purchase just one earbud as a replacement, so decided to go with a cheap replacement pair while I searched for the missing ear bud.  I got these, and I was blown away by how nice they are.  I am sure that they are not as technically perfect sounding as the $175 earbuds I used to have, but for my purposes of wearing them while working in the yard or exercising, I could not tell a difference.  I guess that if I sat quietly in a room and listened hard enough I could tell a difference, but it would be hard.  In the real world, when you are wearing earbuds while doing stuff, these are essentially the same as top line non-sound cancelling earbuds.  These do a good job blocking ambient noise, but do not actively block sounds - my Bose noise cancelling earbuds are still the best at that, but they cost about $300.  For passive sound blocking, these are very good, and are comfortable and stay securely in my ears.  Also, the bluetooth range seemed better, and you can use either the left or right earbud separately, which is great for jogging or anything when you want to remain aware of people around you.  My more expensive pair had only one primary earbud, and when I lost it I could no longer use the other one.  With these, you can use either one.  Also, the wireless charging of the case is great.  Overall, these are an excellent value, and I could go through 5 pairs of these and still be ahead of where I was with the more expensive pair.  After living with these for several months, I came to realize I had been ripped off - not by these earbuds, but by the expensive pair:  they were not even remotely 5 times better than these earbuds.  While I am mad that I lost the expensive earbud, I no longer miss them - these earbuds are probably 90% as good for a tiny fraction of the price. Once these wear out, or I lose them, I will buy more.  They sound great, work well, and are cheap enough that I am not paranoid about losing them.

So much for its ""vaunted"" battery life.  If I read one(1) book, approx 350 pages, battery goes from 100% to approx 65%.  And yes, WiFi is turned off the whole time.  So I can only read approx 2 books per full charge.<br /><br />Love the digital books we have access to in the 21st century, has saved me a lot of room in my house since it's already full of bookcases.<br /><br />HATE getting a new Kindle, won't ever upgrade again.  Wouldn't have done it again this time if I hadn't wanted page-turn buttons so badly (I hate touch screen for page turning).  I have NEVER had a problem-free experience getting a new Kindle and trying to download my library.  I have approx 1600 books and I just bought a 32gb Oasis.  Just like with the last Kindle I bought, approx 20-30% of the books won't download, no matter what I try, plus other errors.  I've also seen this complaint from others.<br /><br />Amazon engineers need to figure out what the problem is, rather than putting the burden on the user to spend days & weeks trying to get access to a library of books we've paid them for.  There is a complete lack of progress on resolving these ongoing problems trying to download libraries to a new device.  Jeff Bezos can put humans in space but his company can't deliver the library I paid them for to my Kindle device?!  Seriously?!<br /><br />You can only transfer books from the cloud to your Kindle by:<br />1)  From your contents page, can only SELECT ALL for up to 25 books at a time, per page, to deliver to your device.  I have 1587 books, which equals 64 pages of books, so I have to do this 64 times.  And 20-30% of these won't actually download!  Will deliver the ""book cover"" to your device, but the actual book won't open.<br />2)  You can download a book to your PC and transfer via USB, but you can only do ONE book at a time!  And the failed download via Whisper Sync will still show on your device, so now you have two(2) books showing on the device but only one will open.  And no way to get that failed download book cover off your device, since the Remove Download option doesn't show/work for a book that didn't actually download!!<br /><br />At least give us an option to download and transfer via USB my entire cloud library, or 25 at a time, to my PC so I can copy/paste to my Kindle via USB.  This method actually does deliver them to my Kindle device, whereas the Whisper Sync won't download large portions of books to a new Kindle device, just book covers with no book there to open.",[],B07GRSK3HC,B07RJZPTLX,AGNJAGHENK57HWBV5W4QMD62E2NQ,1666582111427,4,True,1027,page-turn buttons,hardware_feature,5 stars,positive

226,4.0,Worth the upgrade,"I upgraded from a Kindle Keyboard, which I still have and plan to keep.  I read before bed and like the backlit screen so that I can turn the lights off in the room and read for a while.<br /><br />Back when Barnes & Noble came out with the Nook, I bought it the second it came out.  I promptly sold it on eBay a few days later after not being happy with the ghosting I saw as I turned the pages (a light copy of the previous page could be seen on the current page).  The Paperwhite does not have that problem, thankfully.<br /><br />It's taking me a bit to get used to in terms of finding my way around since there are no buttons, but that's a user issue and not the fault of the device.  I do, however, wish the touch screen was more responsive.  I find that I have to hold something a bit longer or tap a few more times in order to get where I want to go.<br /><br />I will admit that I manually transferred things from my old Kindle to my new one and then had a panic attack when I couldn't access any of the books I'd purchased.  In the moment, it didn't dawn on me that that would be far too easy for people to give copies of the books to other people, but it was an easy fix to go into my account and send them all to my new Kindle.<br /><br />I wish the back of the device wasn't so smooth.  When holding it with one hand (I hold it on the side), I find that my fingers slip.  I'll be getting a case for it so it won't matter, but some might not want a case so a textured back may aid in preventing slippage.<br /><br />All in all, I really like it and am glad I made the upgrade.",[],B00OQVZDJM,B00OQVZDJM,AFQSE62D3NUSJ3FWHLHKIQ7VVIZQ,1474762792000,0,True,1091,upgrade,overall_experience,really like,positive
